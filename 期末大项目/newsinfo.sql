[PHOTO/CHINA NEWS SERVICE]Such frequency of high temperatures in North China \'extremely rare\'The country\'s average number of days with high temperatures in the first half of this year outpaced the same period in all other years since 1961, with 100 national meteorological stations registering temperatures of record highs, according to the National Climate Center.The heat waves this year have come earlier, have been more widespread and are abnormally extreme, the center said in a media release on Sunday.During the first six months of the year, the country on average experienced 4.1 high-temperature days, which are defined as those with temperatures at or above 35 C, higher than the yearly average of 2.2 days, the center noted.Some areas even saw more than 10 high-temperature days during the period, it added.The center said four regional high-temperature events occurred in the country from January to June, with the first one coming 16 days earlier than usual.Altogether, these events lasted for 31 days. During the six-month period, 301 national meteorological stations reported daily high temperatures that reached extreme weather levels, the center said.According to the China Meteorological Administration, there were 10,930 national ground meteorological stations across the country by the end of 2021.The National Climate Center noted North China, which includes Beijing, as one of the most affected by high temperatures.During the heat wave from June 14 to 17, for instance, temperatures above 40 C raged through about 17,000 square kilometers in the region, affecting more than 200 million people, it said.From 2014 to this year, the region was hit by 10 high-temperature events. Such events happened in June in North China in all years during that period except 2014 and 2015.\"But the repeated occurrences of high temperatures (in the region this year) are extremely rare in history,\" it said.The center forecast three high-temperature events in the first half of July in China. It said two of them will affect North China and the area between the Yellow and Huaihe rivers from Saturday to Sunday, and then from Wednesday to July 8.The center is predicting that North China, as well as parts of central and southwestern China, will experience periodic high-temperature events from July to August, with average temperatures 1 to 2 C higher than in normal years.North China and the area between the Yellow and Huaihe rivers are being blanketed by a strong warm air mass, which has been lingering for a long period, said Zhang Fanghua, a chief forecaster of the National Meteorological Center.High pressure in the upper atmosphere is also to blame for the scorching temperatures in the two regions, as it results in fewer clouds and allows more solar radiation to reach the ground, she was quoted as saying by the Guangming Daily newspaper in Beijing.She said the low humidity in the two regions also creates favorable conditions for temperatures to rise.Against the backdrop of climate change, a moderate El Nino — a periodic event that involves warming currents in the Pacific Ocean — that is expected to occur this autumn may lead to more frequent, widespread and extreme weather events in China, the media outlet reported.Gao Hui, another chief forecaster with the National Meteorological Center, said as global warming continues, the number of high-temperature days will increase.', 'days Record seen this hot temperatures high-temperature mete', '2023-07-03', 'By Hou Liqiang (China Daily) 08:30, July 03, 2023', 'People enjoy a foam fight at a water park to escape the heat in Harbin, Heilongjiang province, on S', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0703/c90000-20038529.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Transforming hollow village into thriving tourist destination - People\'s Daily Online', 'This aerial photo shows a view of Hengshanwu Village in Anji County, east China\'s Zhejiang Province, June 5, 2023. (Xinhua/Cai Yang)HANGZHOU, July 3 (Xinhua) -- About 20 years ago, the architect Chen Gu returned to his hometown to prepare to start a business, but instead took over a project to renovate a hollow village administered by Hengshanwu Village in Anji County, east China\'s Zhejiang Province.Hengshanwu was at the time a poor village with a deteriorating environment due to mining activities. The local vegetation was destroyed and the sewage ditches gave off a foul smell. As a result, most locals chose to move away.\"Previously, I had to carry my bicycle on my shoulder to walk back to the village on rainy days because of the muddy dirt roads here,\" said Cai Mingfu, Party chief of Hengshanwu Village.The village saw a turning point in 2003, when Zhejiang launched the Green Rural Revival Program, which involved renovating about 10,000 incorporated villages and transforming about 1,000 central villages among them into examples of moderate prosperity in all respects. Thanks to the program, the village started a campaign of rural renovation and construction, and made significant improvements in hardening its roads, waste collection and dredging its river ditches in the following years.With a brand-new look, Hengshanwu Village began vigorously developing its tourism economy based on its superior nature resources. Local authorities invited the Anji native Chen to help build the once hollow village into a tourist community.\"I grew up in the mountains here and wanted to create a modern, earthy countryside,\" the 52-year-old experienced architect said.Chen spent years on the overall planning and landscape design of the village, as well as the renovation and decoration of the local dwellings. On the basis of preserving the original appearance of the village, he created a cluster of homestays in Hengshanwu and named the area \"Xiaoyin\" in Chinese, meaning an \"escape\" from the city.Locals can rent their houses to Chen\'s professional management team, or they can run the homestays by themselves. \"We don\'t want to drive the people away, but to do a good job in the rural cultural tourism industry and achieve common prosperity together,\" Chen said.Before construction began, Chen developed a cultural theme and style for each homestay according to the personality and areas of expertise of the host. In 2019, the homestay area officially began operations.\"We focus on differentiation and have built 19 homestays with different styles, such as traditional Chinese and Japanese styles,\" Chen said. The homestays also have varied themes such as parenting, tea, reading and mountains. There are also facilities such as a library, restaurants, coffee and dessert shops, bars and artist studios in the area.In 2022, Xiaoyin became a popular spot for social media users, receiving more than 350,000 visitors, bringing in an annual revenue of over 67 million yuan (about 9.29 million U.S. dollars). Its average daily turnover was more than 40,000 yuan during the May Day holiday this year.\"We believe the greatest luxury in the future will be rural life,\" Chen said.Anji native Huang Dong, 45, brought his restaurant chain, Huang Mama\'s Cuisine, to Xiaoyin in 2018. After its environmental and service upgrades, the mist-shrouded, garden-style restaurant has attracted plenty of diners from afar.\"Although our restaurant is in a village, the per capita consumption of customers can reach about 200 yuan, and it is often full during holidays,\" Huang said.Even through the COVID-19 pandemic, the restaurant maintained an average annual revenue of about 20 million yuan. \"Our revenue is expected to hit about 25 million yuan this year,\" Huang said.He said the success of the restaurant is inseparable from the village\'s excellent business environment. The local government not only provides policy support for enterprises, but also helps to dispose of waste and carry out regional greening work. As one of the major businesses in the area, Huang\'s restaurant also receives a subsidy of 300,000 yuan from the government every year.\"We can really feel that the government is serving the business, and it gives us a lot of autonomy. But for us, we have more pressure and build the area like home,\" Huang said.In 2022, the tourism revenue of Hengshanwu Village was 108 million yuan, and the per capita net income of locals exceeded 55,000 yuan.\"The biggest change brought about by the Green Rural Revival Program was the uniting of people\'s hearts. When people are united and full of vigor, the road to common prosperity becomes wider and wider,\" Cai said. Tourists take photos at a restaurant in Hengshanwu Village in Anji County, east China\'s Zhejiang Province, June 5, 2023.

(Xinhua/Xiao Yijiu)WUHAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Undeterred by the scorching summer sun, 64-year-old photographer Yang He patiently awaits at the bank of the Yangtze River in Yichang City of central China\'s Hubei Province every noon to capture finless porpoises with his shutter.\"At noon, the ray of sunlight is strong enough to penetrate the river surface, so I can see what\'s going on in the water. Moreover, there\'s a higher likelihood of finless porpoises coming to the surface when the water gets warmer,\" said Yang, who started taking photos of finless porpoises five years ago.He told Xinhua that the finless porpoises are reminiscent of his childhood. \"I have vivid memories of playing by the riverbank and witnessing herds of finless porpoises frolicking in the water,\" recalled Yang, adding that as human activity intensified in the Yichang section of the Yangtze River over the years, it became increasingly challenging to catch sight of these magnificent mammals.Known as the \"giant panda of the water,\" the Yangtze finless porpoise is under top-level state protection and serves as a barometer of the Yangtze River ecology.To restore the biodiversity along the river, China imposed a full fishing ban in 332 conservation areas of the Yangtze River basin in January 2020. The move has since been expanded to a 10-year moratorium along the river\'s main streams and major tributaries, effective Jan. 1, 2021.By the end of 2022, China had channeled over 26.9 billion yuan (about 3.71 billion U.S. dollars) to support fishermen after they gave up using nets and boats on the Yangtze River.The fishing ban and removal of the big polluters have improved biodiversity in the Yangtze River. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the population of the Yangtze finless porpoises had increased to 1,249 in 2022, up 23.42 percent from five years ago. The species has been more frequently spotted in Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.\"Back in 2017, capturing even a single photograph of finless porpoises in Yichang throughout the entire year was a challenge,\" said Yang. \"However, things took a turn in 2020 as more sightings of finless porpoises began to be reported. Once I saw a pod of five or six of them and tirelessly searched along the river for months until I eventually discovered that they had settled in the Dianjun district.The chemical industry was once the backbone of the district\'s economy. For instance, the Tiantian Chemical Plant, which was set up in the 1970s, could generate tens of millions of yuan in tax revenue each year. For the protection of the Yangtze River\'s ecology, however, the plant was closed in 2017.\"Now I can put my hand on my heart and say that I can capture finless porpoises with my camera every day,\" Yang said.Other aquatic bioresources in the key waters of the Yangtze River have also seen a recovery. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, in 2022, 193 varieties of fish were spotted in these waters, marking an increase of 25 varieties from 2020.\"Protecting the Yangtze finless porpoise is protecting the aquatic biodiversity of the Yangtze River,\" said Wang Ding, an academician with the Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.Noting that the recovery of the mammal is an encouraging sign, Wang said there is still a long way to go in terms of protecting the species and the Yangtze River as a whole.\"We should continue to focus on the protection of finless porpoises, and use scientific investigations to know the status quo of all the aquatic species and their habitats along the Yangtze River. Meanwhile, the possible risk factors and the effects of protection measures should be analyzed to further formulate targeted protection plans,\" Wang added. This udated photo shows photographer Yang He taking photos of finless porpoises at the bank of the Yangtze River in Yichang City, central China\'s Hubei Province.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('What Yellen discusses in China will be a weather vane - People\'s Daily Online', 'After many days of speculation, it was finally confirmed by both Chinese and American sides that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will visit China from July 6 to 9. Following US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\'s visit to China nearly three weeks ago, this visit by another high-ranking US official indicates, to a certain level, a gradual restoration of communication channels between the two countries. As one of the key figures responsible for US economic and trade affairs, Yellen\'s visit to China has attracted special attention, as it is believed to hold significant importance. This reflects the expectations of stability in China-US economic and trade relations amid the global economic downturn.Compared with her counterparts in Washington, Yellen has a relatively pragmatic attitude toward China. She has previously expressed opposition to \"decoupling\" from China and advocated for establishing \"necessary\" and \"constructive\" economic relations with China. She has also expressed her desire to visit China on multiple occasions. In a recent hearing last month, Yellen stated that it is not in US\' interest to stifle the economic progress of the Chinese people, and that the US should applaud for China\'s success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Therefore, whether Yellen\'s visit can achieve pragmatic results holds symbolic significance: whether Washington is focusing on \"competition\" or cooperation represents a certain weather vane to judge whether rationality remains in Washington\'s China policy.However, before Yellen sets off, Washington has already revealed a number of crucial messages, and these complex signals are worth careful interpretation. Alongside the announcement of Yellen\'s visit to China, the US once again emphasized the so-called \"three principles\" regarding economic relations with China, which were proposed by Yellen in a speech in April. This seems to set the tone for Yellen\'s trip to China in advance, but these \"three principles\" do not release many positive signals for dialogue. The first principle emphasizes the protection of US and its allies\' \"national security interests,\" which raises concerns about an overarching securitization. If the US cannot break free from its stubbornly tough stance on China, can the professional voice from US finance field break through the obstacles and bring tangible results for China-US economic and trade cooperation? When the concept of \"national security\" has become an omnipresent fog, whether Yellen can avoid the \"security trap\" remains a question.We also noticed that, some US officials said Yellen\'s trip will not achieve significant \"breakthroughs,\" but they hope \"to have constructive conversations and build longer-term channels of communication with China\'s new economic team.\" Washington officials\' \"low expectations for breakthrough\" indicates one thing: the US political circle is well aware of China\'s position and attitude when communicating with US officials. On the one hand, China is willing to actively engage in communication with US officials and strive to achieve cooperation results through dialogue; on the other hand, China always maintains a firm stance on its core interests and principles.In order to make this visit fruitful, instead of basing expectations of \"breakthroughs\" on a \"US First\" approach, the US would be better to start with the most realistic issues in the current China-US economic and trade field.For example, the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods during the Trump administration have not been abolished, and the fact has already proven that it harms both parties. Currently, the tariff on US products imported to Chinese is 7.1 percent, while the tariff on Chinese exports to the US is 19.2 percent, which is unequal. In addition, the high tariffs are borne by American businessmen and the public, and they also have an impact on US\' inflation. However, the Biden administration done nothing to correct this mistake.Furthermore, the US is currently abusing the concept of national security to a severe extent, even trampling on the principles of free trade and international market rules. This has seriously disrupted normal investment and trade activities between the two countries, with more than 1,300 Chinese entities still on various US control and sanctions lists. When everything is being connected to national security, it becomes difficult to do business. Yellen, as the US Treasury Secretary, should understand that such harm is by no means one-way.We believe that if Yellen\'s visit can achieve some substantive progress, it would bring more certainty and stability to the business communities of both China and the US, which would be much more beneficial than the \"breakthroughs\" envisioned by Washington\'s anti-China politicians.Also in the near future, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry will visit China again, and US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is also reportedly planning to visit China. Achieving a series of contacts and interactions under highly tense circumstances between China and the US is not easy. The key to making them truly valuable lies in whether both sides can promote practical matters that benefit both countries and their peoples with a professional and pragmatic attitude. China has always adhered to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in dealing with the US. We hope to see tangible actions from the US to meet each other halfway.', 'visit Yellens principles Treasury security professional coop', '2023-07-04', 'By Global Times editorial (Global Times) 08:42, July 04, 2023', 'After many days of speculation, it was finally confirmed by both Chinese and American sides that US', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0704/c90000-20039141.html');

They constantly deepen political mutual trust and strengthen solidarity, resolutely oppose external interference, hegemonism and power politics, and promote upgrading of regional cooperation. They offer solid support for each other\'s development, prosperity, security and stability.The more volatile the international situation is, the more the SCO member states need to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit, enhance cohesion, consolidate solidarity and cooperation and hold their future firmly in their own hands.Security is the precondition for development, and peace and stability remain a common aspiration. The SCO member states adhere to political mutual trust and constantly expand security cooperation. They signed the world\'s first inter-governmental anti-extremism treaty, organized \"Peace Mission\" counter-terrorism military drills, and advocate for political settlement of international and regional hotspot issues including the Afghan issue.The SCO not only plays a positive role in safeguarding the peace and stability of Eurasia, but also contributes to world peace and development.During last year\'s SCO Samarkand summit, Xi expounded on the significance of the Global Security Initiative (GSI), called on all countries to stay true to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, offering a clear path to maintaining long-term stability of the region and expanding SCO security cooperation.The SCO member states\' implementing the GSI helps them deepen security cooperation and cope with security challenges.To deliver a better life for people of all countries in the region is a shared goal of the SCO member states. The Global Development Initiative proposed by Xi has been appraised by SCO member states. They believe the initiative is of important significance for international energy security, food security and other global development challenges, and will help the world achieve more robust, greener and more balanced development.This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As connectivity is constantly being built between the BRI and other countries\' development strategies, the Eurasian Economic Union and other regional cooperation initiatives, a pattern of high-quality regional interconnectivity is taking shape. A series of cooperation projects have been implemented and made remarkable achievements, such as the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan highway, the China-Central Asia natural gas pipeline and the Tajikistan Agriculture and Textile Industrial Park, bringing tangible benefits to local people.China will keep working with regional countries to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and build more growth drivers.Interactions between civilizations provide the most solid foundation for the SCO\'s development, and people-to-people exchanges provide the strongest driving force for the organization.The SCO member states enjoy geographical proximity and cultural affinity, as well as a long history of friendly association. Making full use of these advantages, they are constantly strengthening mutual learning among civilizations and fostering a closer people-to-people bond.Because of this, the SCO has risen above differences in ideology, social system and development path, and set a good example in new-type international relations.The Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) proposed by Xi is highly consistent with the Shanghai Spirit. Implementing the initiative will energize SCO member states in strengthening experience sharing on national governance and mutual learning.By promoting people-to-people exchanges under the SCO framework, China is consolidating the public foundation for SCO development.The country has planned to provide 1,000 training opportunities in poverty alleviation for other SCO countries, open 10 Luban Workshops, and launch 30 cooperation projects in such areas as health, poverty relief, culture and education under the framework of the Silk Road Community Building Initiative. Besides, it has also held the SCO non-governmental friendship forum.As a founding member, China always views the SCO as a high priority in its diplomacy. The world today is living through accelerating changes unseen in a century, and global development entering a new phase of instability and transformation.

Regional conflicts are raging. The Cold War mentality and group politics are resurfacing, and so are unilateralism and hegemonism. Economic globalization has also encountered headwinds.A more turbulent and intertwined world is calling for a closer SCO community. Only by further unleashing the potential of the SCO as a concerted driving force in pursuing common prosperity, can the region, and the world as a whole, be better poised to meet the looming challenges.To that end, it is first of all imperative to further enhance strategic independence and boost mutual trust. Interference by external forces has become an imminent threat to regional peace and stability. The SCO should guard against attempts by external forces to instigate \"color revolutions,\" and jointly oppose interference in other countries\' internal affairs under any pretext.Second, it is necessary to maintain regional peace by expanding security cooperation. By implementing the Global Security Initiative, SCO members should jointly crack down on terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and other transnational organized crimes. Member countries should also effectively meet the challenges in data security, biosecurity, outer space security and other non-traditional security domains.Third, it is of great significance to promote interconnected development by upholding openness and inclusiveness. Member countries should strengthen their cooperation in such areas as trade and investment, infrastructure building, supply-chain protection, scientific and technological innovation and artificial intelligence, opposing any acts that violate international economic order and market rules.Fourth, it is important to uphold multilateralism and build a more just and equitable international order. Member countries should safeguard the UN-centered international system and the international order based on international law, reject zero-sum game and bloc politics, advocate multilateralism and improve global governance by upholding fairness and justice.As scheduled, the SCO family will initiate another round of expansion during this summit. With more and more countries joining the SCO, it is bound to play a greater role in global governance. China stands ready to work together with both old and new members of the SCO family to foster consensus, deepen cooperation, and create a better future for the Eurasian continent and the world as a whole with a closer SCO community. ', 'The countries Cooperation Organization prosperity mutual clo', '2023-07-04', ' (Xinhua) 13:50, July 04, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooper', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0704/c90000-20039326.html');

When unmanned agricultural machinery were used to plant rice seedlings at the farm for the first time, local farmers were amazed by the fact that they finished the workload in a short time.To fully gain information about the growth of rice, the Foshan-Zhongke Innovation Research Institute of Intelligent Agriculture and Robotics team developed a data collection module to obtain parameters such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, light conditions, precipitation, wind speed, and wind direction in the fields, as well as temperature, humidity, and content of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, acid and alkali in soil, from each monitoring device, and to manage the farm using an information system.Thanks to the management of Chen and his teammates, harvesters were used to harvest early-season rice five months after they were planted at the farm that year. Compared with traditional farming methods, intelligent farming increased the yield of rice per mu (667 square meters) by over 100 kilograms and reduced costs by 300 yuan ($41.40). The rice was also of better quality and was sold at a higher price because of the digital management of the farm.Chen also taught villagers to fly agricultural drones. Many young villagers established agricultural machinery technology service teams to offer services to farmers in neighboring areas.Agricultural digitalization, with the help of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and other technologies, realizes intelligent agricultural production, improves agricultural production efficiency and quality of agricultural products, and helps farmers make more accurate and science-based decisions by applying the IoT for data collection and analysis, Chen said.Robots equipped with sensors at the farm are used to obtain information about cherry tomatoes, plan routes, avoid obstacles, and harvest them according to their ripeness levels.\"We are constantly improving the technical parameters of the robot system to make it more convenient for farmers to use them,\" Chen said.\"The farm has become a calling card of Jitian village,\" said Chen, who has witnessed the changes intelligent agriculture has brought to the village over the past two years.Jitian was a small barren village, but the farm in the village was recognized as a provincial-level agricultural science park, attracting an increasing number of visitors and many enterprises. The village has built an agricultural exhibition hall and developed the B&B business and tourism.Chen believes that digital technologies in China\'s agriculture show promise.With China\'s strong support for agricultural modernization and an increasing demand for digital agricultural equipment, the cost of the equipment is expected to be further reduced, he said.Agricultural digital technicians need to be familiar with the growth of crops, know about technologies including the IoT and big data analysis, and provide more intelligent solutions to farming, Chen said.He added that he will continue to learn about the planting and management procedures of different crops, communicate with farmers and combine their planting experience with digital technologies to enable more farmers to enjoy the convenience of the digitalization of agriculture.', 'agriculture', '2023-07-04', ' (People\'s Daily Online) 13:35, July 04, 2023', 'Several drones recently sprayed pesticides over paddy fields at a farm in Jitian village, Gaoming di', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0704/c98649-20039322.html');

(Xinhua/Li Yibo)BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese civilization, characterized by its vast scope and profound depth, stands as a treasure trove of inspiration for contemporary Chinese worldview.Stretching back over 5,000 years without interruption, the Chinese civilization boasts the prominent features of consistency, originality, uniformity, inclusivity and peaceful nature.The fact that Chinese civilization is highly consistent is the fundamental reason why the Chinese nation must follow its own path. Its originality explains why the Chinese nation upholds fine traditions but never blindly sticks to the old ways. It is also the reason why the Chinese nation is fearless in the face of new challenges and is always open to new things.China is a unified multiethnic country, with all 56 ethnic groups united in diversity. Different ethnic groups work together for common development and prosperity. This strong uniformity determines that national unification always remains at the heart of China\'s core interests, with a strong and unified country being the foundation upon which the well-being of all Chinese people depends.The inclusivity of the Chinese civilization is exemplified by the harmonious coexistence of diverse religious beliefs and the openness of Chinese culture to world civilizations. The China-proposed initiatives, such as the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, call for shared prosperity and the exchange of diverse cultures.Chinese traditional philosophy contains abundant wisdom on foreign relations. The peaceful nature of Chinese civilization implies that China will continue to build world peace and contribute to global development. It determines that China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace and follows a path of peaceful development.For thousands of years, the ancient Chinese saying \"harmony is the most precious\" has been embedded in the minds of Chinese people and has continued to have a profound influence on their attitude toward life. The phrase has evolved from an important moral concept of the Confucian school in managing interpersonal relations to a reference to harmonious and peaceful relationships among people, groups and states.In an increasingly connected world fraught with grave challenges, the wisdom of harmony sheds light on how humanity can create a prosperous and peaceful future in a sustainable, environmentally friendly and cooperative way.', 'peaceful Chinas Initiative photo northwest Province build fe', '2023-07-05', ' (Xinhua) 08:11, July 05, 2023', 'This photo taken on May 11, 2023 shows a Tang Dynasty (618-907) tri-colored figurine of camel-ridin', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039586.html');

This is one of Xi\'s most important suggestions, he said, which must be a guiding principle for building trust and strengthening the organization.The SCO is perhaps the most important and inclusive organization of Eurasian countries and is immune to Cold War baggage, said Karori Singh, former director and emeritus fellow of the South Asia Studies Centre at India\'s University of Rajasthan.Singh said Xi emphasized mutual trust as the key to enhance cooperation and gave an assurance of working with other nations for global security. Xi urged SCO member states to be vigilant against outside interference in the region and suggested working toward the uplifting of people in Afghanistan, he added.Singh noted that Xi said there is a need to prevent artificial barriers being established and to ensure productive cooperation, under which development experiences can be shared to deepen progress and ensure peace.Atul Dalakoti, executive director of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said he was impressed that Xi talked about safeguarding regional peace, and strengthening exchanges to create win-win cooperation between member states leading to pragmatic and more meaningful economic cooperation. This will result in more sustainable and balanced economic recoveries for SCO countries.The Shanghai Spirit champions mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development. Xi\'s remarks are \"in line with the Shanghai Spirit to enhance solidarity and mutual trust to achieve a better tomorrow\", Dalakoti said.Lawrence Loh, director of the National University of Singapore\'s Centre for Governance and Sustainability, said Xi\'s speech reinforced the importance of the SCO in spearheading global peace and prosperity. \"Coming on the heels of deepening geopolitical tensions, the speech emphasized the need for mutual trust and interaction among countries to safeguard a peaceful world for all,\" he said.In the sensitive Asian region, good diplomacy must be based on respect and reciprocity, and countries should not engage in or instigate actions that affect the sovereignty of others, he said.In the face of the macroeconomic challenges faced by many developing Asian countries, efforts must be made to foster strong economic recovery, Loh said. \"Regional collaborations such as the Belt and Road Initiative will put countries on the path of good economic progress that will benefit their people,\" he said.Ramay, from the institute in Islamabad, said that on the economic front Xi had stressed the importance of cooperation and China\'s willingness to share the fruits of its success, citing Xi\'s emphasis on synergizing BRI objectives with national aspirations and the development agendas of member states.Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Griffith University in Australia, said Xi\'s address highlights several important aspects of global health security within the SCO context. \"The emphasis on enhancing solidarity and mutual trust among SCO members is crucial for effective collaboration in addressing health security challenges,\" he said.', 'Xis of speech Experts importance laud said SCO Cooperation H', '2023-07-05', 'By XU WEIWEI in Hong Kong (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:26, July 05, 2023', 'Chinese President Xi Jinping addresses the 23rd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Sha', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039627.html');

Human society faces unprecedented challenges, and to the questions raised by our times, President Xi’s answer is: the people\'s wish for a happy life is our goal, and peace, development and win-win cooperation are the unstoppable trends of the times.President Xi\'s remarks grasp the essence of regional and global issues and provides China\'s propositions and solutions, such as the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative. More Specifically, China proposes that the SCO promote the establishment of an SCO development bank and enhance the connection of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with development strategies of various countries and regional cooperation initiatives. People are looking forward to further strengthening policy measures such as improving connectivity in the future.In this important speech, President Xi also emphasized the \"right direction\" for the SCO, which encompasses two specific aspects. First, regarding internal interactions, China advocates for \"bridging differences through dialogue, and replacing competition with cooperation.” We should truly respect each other\'s core interests and major concerns, and firmly support each other\'s endeavor for development and rejuvenation. Second, the speech addresses the correct way to interact with the external world, with the core principle being \"independence and autonomy.\" We must be highly vigilant against external attempts to foment a “new Cold War” or camp-based confrontation in our region. The future of our development must be held firmly in our own hands. This not only represents the right direction advocated by China but also condensed the successful practices of the SCO over the years.President Xi\'s important speech encapsulates the greatest common denominator of the SCO and comprehensively addresses the core demands of member countries, thereby generating widespread resonance. Considering that the SCO covers over 40 percent of the global population, about a quarter of the world\'s land area, with a combined GDP exceeding $23 trillion, and its member states have complex and even contentious relationships, it is extremely challenging for such a vast international organization to seek core consensus, overcome and transcend significant differences and specific disputes, and achieve broad unity and cooperation. It can be said that the SCO has achieved this, making it a successful international organization characterized by pioneering and exploratory endeavors.According to Western geopolitical thinking and logic, the SCO lacks a common external enemy and faces prominent internal contradictions. Additionally, unlike Western alliance systems with a clear leader like the US, the SCO\'s member states are considered equal. This line of thinking suggests that such an international organization is difficult to establish and even if it is established, it would struggle to achieve significant progress and growth.However, in reality, after 22 years of development, the SCO has evolved into a \"big family\" with nine member states, three observer states, and 14 dialogue partners, totaling 26 members. Many countries showed great interest in the SCO. This demonstrates that beyond surface-level conflicts and disagreements, there is a stronger force and resilient bond that brings everyone together, as President Xi mentioned: the people\'s wish for a happy life and the unstoppable trends of peace, development and win-win cooperation.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also referred to the SCO as a \"big family\" in his speech on Tuesday. It is evident that SCO members cherish the atmosphere of unity and mutual trust, and they have a tacit understanding not to bring bilateral issues into the organization to affect their unity. As the US intensifies its mobilization for a \"new Cold War\" and global governance mechanisms face difficulties and fragmentation, there is a widespread sense of being at a loss in the international community, particularly among developing countries who feel disoriented. This is when there is a need for a new organization and mode of interaction to provide the world with an alternative and hope. The global significance of the SCO lies in this aspect—it provides support for improving global governance through concrete actions.Under the backdrop of a major global transformation, the SCO also faces various challenges. The threats posed by both traditional and non-traditional security issues have become more prominent. Economic cooperation encounters internal and external obstacles, leading to slow progress. The negative impact of external forces on the SCO cannot be ignored. The prolonged and complex Ukraine crisis has also had a spillover effect on the organization. Some existing mechanisms of the SCO may require reform and adjustments, and its execution power and efficiency need continuous improvement. However, we believe that the SCO will withstand these tests.

The black-and-white body is also one of the adorable features of pandas. This \"colorway\" helps pandas keep warm on mountains and in forests and is also the animal\'s camouflage. However, not all pandas are black and white.

However, in bamboo groves, they don\'t need a strong visual ability.Pandas are pigeon-toed. Their wobbly walks make them very cute. Such slow movement helps them save strength. Besides, pandas can swim and climb trees, and have flexible joints that enable them to make unexpected moves.Fossils of the ancestral panda Ailurarctos lufengensis, the oldest panda found so far, were discovered in Lufeng, southwest China\'s Yunnan province. The ancestral panda lived in the late Miocene about 8 million years ago, and was a rare species native to China.Since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government has never ceased its protection of pandas. It has set up four giant panda nature reserves in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Besides, biological studies of pandas gradually developed in China. The country has been one of the leaders in the world in terms of panda research since 1990s thanks to the joint efforts of Chinese scientists.To get a clear picture of the panda population is the foundation and premise of science-based panda protection. Since 1974, China has conducted four panda censuses. According to the latest census, the population and the area of panda habitats both grew more than 10 percent.A panda cub eats bamboo by its mother in Wolong, southwest China\'s Sichuan province. (People\'s Daily Online/He Shengshan)As of the end of 2013, the population of giant pandas living in the wild exceeded 1,800, and that population was divided in different locations, among which giant pandas in some locations had a population less than 30, which made it extremely difficult to maintain the population with on-site protection.Therefore, China initiated a wilderness training program for giant pandas, which aims at releasing artificially bred pandas to expand endangered panda populations in the wild. So far, more than 10 captive pandas have been released through this creative protection method.In October 2021, China announced to build the first batch of national parks, including one for giant pandas. The giant panda national park covers an area of about 2.2 million hectares and 60 percent of panda habitats, where more than 70 percent of wild giant pandas live. The establishment of the giant panda national park marked a new phase of China\'s panda protection.In 2016, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the species off its endangered list and downgraded the conservation status of giant pandas to \"vulnerable.\" It reflected the remarkable achievements made by China in the protection of giant pandas and demonstrated the country\'s sense of responsibility as a major country in natural conservation.

The second treaty established the reservation as the tribe\'s \"permanent home,\" which was deemed by the Navajo Nation as a promise including a sufficient supply of water.\"The 1868 treaty did impose a number of specific duties on the United States, but the treaty said nothing about any affirmative duty for the United States to secure water,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, wrote in the majority opinion.Thirty-seven tribal governments, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and the San Luis Rey Indian Water Authority filed an amicus brief in support of the Navajo Nation in February 2023, according to the Drum.The brief urged the Supreme Court to respect the water rights doctrine and enforce the trust relationship under which the United States had an obligation to assure water for the Navajo Reservation, the Drum added.\"Water is necessary for all life, and when our ancestors negotiated agreements with the United States to secure our lands and our protection, water was understood and still is understood to be inseparable from the land and from our peoples,\" said NCAI President Fawn Sharp.\"The Supreme Court has once again assisted in the United States\' centuries-long attempts to try to get out of the promises they have made to Tribal Nations by stating that treaties only secure access to water, but do not require the United States to take any steps to protect or provide that water to our people,\" she added.', 'the Navajo tribe secure treaties tribal Tribes understood No', '2023-07-05', ' (Xinhua) 10:16, July 05, 2023', 'DENVER, the United States, July 4 (Xinhua) -- America\'s shameful tradition of breaking treaties and', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039833.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Feature: Teamwork makes China champion after 12-year wait at Women\'s Basketball Asia Cup - People\'s Daily Online', 'SYDNEY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Confetti was thrown, medals were gold, and the glittering Asia Cup trophy was passed through 12 players of the China women\'s basketball national team and their head coach Zheng Wei, who stood together on the champions\' podium to cheers and applause.The glorious moment came after China\'s 73-71 decisive victory over five-time title-holder Japan on Sunday. But the scenes of jubilation had looked surreal to Zheng, as the whole team, including herself, had never expected to end a 12-year championship drought amid injuries and missing key players.Captain Yang Liwei had suffered a left leg injury in the dying stages of the semifinal against hosts Australia, which left them with only 11 players available for their tough match against formidable Japan.Reigning champions Japan appeared insurmountable having thrashed every opponent until the final, with an average winning margin of 35 points and hitting 14.5 three-pointers per game, as they expertly showcased their aggressive style.With their injured captain on the bench offering support, Wang Siyu, Jin Weina, Li Meng, Pan Zhenqi, and Han Xu - a squad of 2022 World Cup silver medalists - walked onto the Quaycentre court as the starting five, primed for a litmus test with Japan.The 101-minute rollercoaster saw 15 lead changes and the final result wasn\'t determined until the last five seconds when Li Meng shot two free throws and extended China\'s advantage to 73-68.A last-ditch three-pointer by Japan\'s Stephanie Mawuli reduced the margin, but it wasn\'t enough as China\'s celebrations started with gusto.\"All of us on the bench, including the players and coaches, felt an explosion of happiness when Li Meng made those two free throws. We knew that victory was in the bag,\" recalled Gao Song, a veteran power forward wearing the No. 13 jersey.As the seconds ticked down and China\'s title was finally assured, the anxious Chinese players on the bench shot out of their seats and dashed onto the court hugging each other.Li Meng also walked off the court, tightly embracing Yang Liwei and lifting China\'s captain in her arms.The scene was reminiscent of the China-U.S. blockbuster at the 2022 World Cup. After China\'s Wu Tongtong badly injured her knees, it was teammate Dilana Dilixiati that helped her off the court in a similar fashion.Neither Wu nor Dilixiati returned to Sydney for the Asia Cup but accompanied the team in a different way.When the Chinese players got changed and came back to the court for the medal ceremony, the red \"Champions China\" T-shirt that Yang Liwei was wearing caught the attention of some eagle-eyed observers.\"Wu Tongtong\", \"Dilana Dilixiati\", \"Xu Chenyan\", \"Wang Jiaqi\". Names of those who had participated in the training camp and major players who couldn\'t compete due to injury were written on the shirt.This was another callback to last year\'s World Cup. Li Meng, who had a high fever after scoring 23 points in a physically draining quarterfinal against France, received her silver medal in a white T-shirt also filled with handwritten names.For China women\'s basketball team, teamwork is perpetually the top priority, and only in a united team can an individual\'s capability be multiplied. These aspiring girls care about their peers, cherish their bonds, take pride in \"teamwork basketball\" and call themselves \"Wu Wei Jin Lan\", or \"Fearless Sworn Sisters\".\"The spirit of China women\'s basketball team is that we focus on teamwork. That explains why we achieved a good result last year at the World Cup. Because we were united, we fought as a team, and then everyone could play to their advantage. When one player is not in good form, there is always someone else in the team who can help save the game,\" said Li Meng.\"For our team, a basketball match never relies on one person or two. Each of us plays a part,\" said Li, a consistent sharpshooter who also accumulated a team-high 24 assists at the Asia Cup.During the fourth quarter of the nerve-wracking China-Japan final, when the crowd was dazzled by Li Meng\'s iconic three-pointer gesture, observant photographers captured the detail on her left-foot sneaker - \"KEEP FIGHTING CHINA\" written in neon pink.Awarded MVP after averaging 22 points and 11.8 rebounds, Han Xu shared an identical focus on teamwork like Li Meng.Speaking of the team\'s youngsters, Han said that she had full trust in her \"talented, eminent and valiant\" teammates and offered her support to them from inside the paint.\"As a post player like me, I want to attract more attention of the defense and create more opportunities for our team. I also encouraged all the young players on my team and helped our team to go forward,\" said 24-year-old Han.China may have gone through the title undefeated, but they had to endure several speedbumps to reclaim the title of Asian champions.Severe injuries prevented key players such as Wu Tongtong, Li Yueru and Huang Sijing from appearing on the court, while young guns in the 12-person line-up, including Luo Xinyu, Tang Yu and Yang Shuyu, represented China for the first time in a continental tournament. Meanwhile, Yang Liwei, Han Xu, and Li Meng rushed back to the team from WNBA duties.Developing chemistry and cohesion for this newly-assembled team within a short span proved difficult for the players and their coaches.\"Actually, at the beginning of the tournament, our team was not in very good shape. Even when we competed with those teams that are not very powerful, we still ran into problems and had modest field-goal percentages,\" said head coach Zheng Wei. \"But we overcame our difficulties one by one, and adjusted ourselves game after game.\"\"We always encourage the players to remember the spirit of Team China and always remind them to play together as a team, put on their mettle, and never give up,\" said Zheng.China\'s teamwork left a deep impression on Lebanon head coach Georges El Dabbak Geagea after their opening game.\"They went by a team effort physically and focused for 40 minutes. That\'s the way they play in China. They were up, they were down, but they play the same tempo. So that\'s something really important that I believe we should learn from,\" he added.At the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship for Women, Gao Song, a then-19-year-old player wearing the No. 12 jersey, grabbed the gold with her older sisters in Japan.Twelve years later, Gao felt thrilled and grateful to help the team clinch the title despite the ups and downs.\"Our China women\'s basketball team always fights as a whole. While we get stuck in adversity, we never concede to difficulties. There is a \'centripetal force\' drawing us closely,\" said Gao.On Monday, the Chinese players departed from Sydney, Australia, on different journeys; the majority flew back to China, while Li Meng and Han Xu traveled to the United States to resume their WNBA duties.\"I have become more confident now, and so has our whole team. I think we will continue to improve ourselves step by step, work hard for every practice and get ready for bigger goals in the future,\" said Han.', 'team We Meng their players WNBA Basketball Chinas bench Team', '2023-07-05', ' (Xinhua) 10:53, July 05, 2023', 'SYDNEY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Confetti was thrown, medals were gold, and the glittering Asia Cup trophy', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:29', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039866.html');

This means longer supply periods and cheaper prices for Chinese consumers.With the industrialization of blueberry cultivation, the blueberry season can last from March to October in China, with the average price of the fruit being much lower than that of imported blueberries sold during November and February.Photo shows a farmer harvesting blueberries at a blueberry orchard in Sucun township, Yinan county, east China\'s Shandong Province, June 9, 2023. (Xinhua/Yin Jun)As China\'s fruit industry’s number of new varieties blooms and becomes higher in quality, domestic fruits are becoming an increasingly common sight at fruit markets across the country.\"One of our large retailers told us that about 10 years ago, 90 percent of the fruits they sold were imported, while the proportion of domestic fruits today has exceeded 30 percent and is increasing,\" said Liu Chengxin, general manager of Hainan Xiyuan Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd. The company, based in south China\'s Hainan Province, specializes in the cultivation and sale of tropical and subtropical fruits. It has supplied many new types of high-quality homegrown fruits and vegetables to the domestic market in recent years.\"In fact, brand building and large-scale development was proposed and practiced in the domestic fruit industry seven or eight years ago. Since it takes time for an agricultural endeavor to yield fruits, consumers didn\'t enjoy the results of these efforts until recent years,\" Zhai Shujia, an executive of the agricultural technology and product incubation center of Alibaba\'s online community group buying platform, Taibao Maicai.More types of lesser-known fruitsChina\'s total fruit planting area grew to more than 12.8 million hectares in 2021, with the area of traditional fruits like apples and pears decreasing while that of lesser-known fruits, including cherries, kiwi fruit, and strawberries, continuing to rise, according to a report on the development of China\'s fruit industry in 2022 published by China Fruit Marketing Association.Recently, the news that the first batch of homegrown durians are about to ripen in Hainan has heartened Chinese consumers eager to enjoy domestic durians for the first time.Photo taken on June 6, 2023 shows a tourist picking cherries at an orchard in Duzhuang township, Haigang district, Qinhuangdao city, north China\'s Hebei Province. (Xinhua/Yang Shiyao)Hainan Xiyuan Ecological Agriculture Co.,. Ltd. has planted 1,300 mu (about 86.67 hectares) of Musang King durian in its plantation. The durian trees, which have begun to bear fruit, are expected to provide fresh Musang King durians for the Chinese market for the first time, as all Musang King durian imports from abroad have been frozen fruit so far.Data released by the International Blueberry Organization (IBO) showed that the global planting area of blueberries reached 235,400 hectares in 2021, and China, with a total blueberry planting area of nearly 70,000 hectares, has surpassed the U.S., Chile, and Peru to become the world\'s largest producer of blueberries.While blueberry is not a traditional fruit in China, it is now grown on a large scale in more than 20 provincial-level regions in China, thanks to surging consumer demand in the country.Upgraded post-harvest treatment and transportationChina is the largest producer of kiwi fruit in the world, according to the report on the development of China\'s fruit industry in 2022, which noted that China made up more than 50 percent of the global kiwi fruit supply in 2020. However, China is also the largest importer of kiwi fruit, according to the report.Due to the country\'s lack of advanced post-harvest preservation technology and means of transporting fresh fruit, China has been unable to ensure a sufficient supply of ready-to-eat kiwi fruit for the domestic market. As a result, it imports a large quantity of high-quality kiwi fruit from foreign countries every year.\"About three or four years ago, we noticed that imported ready-to-eat kiwi fruit sold very well in China, and there was no domestic fruit that could compete with it,\" said Zhai, who revealed that Alibaba\'s subsidiary that specializes in digital agriculture has been working together with outstanding kiwi fruit production areas to cultivate and promote homegrown ready-to-eat kiwi fruit over the past years.Their endeavor has paid off well. Zhai\'s team has made great achievements in the development of ripening technology for kiwi fruit and finally managed to make sure their ready-to-eat kiwi fruit provided for consumers are at the peak tasting period when they have just the right amount of firmness and sweetness.Shaanxi Lyuyilong Agriculture and Forestry Development Co., Ltd., a company based in Wugong county, northwest China\'s Shaanxi Province, operates 1,800 mu of kiwi fruit orchards. All the kiwi fruit produced by these orchards are ready for consumption as they enter the terminal market, which has been the largest change seen in the orchards in the recent couple of years.\"Ready-to-eat kiwi fruit guarantees a good consumer experience. Their supply still falls short of demand. We don\'t need to worry about sales as long as our quality is good,\" said Liu Xiaofeng, an executive of the company.Many industry insiders believe that China\'s massive consumer market\'s demand for the stable quality, continuous supply, and reasonable price of fruit is constantly driving the country\'s fruit industry toward large-scale and standardized development.

(SBS), a zipper manufacturer in Jinjiang, southeast China\'s Fujian province has sent its zipper products to the space for a sixth time.Zippers for spacesuits are by no means the ones used on average clothes. Space missions need super reliable, stable and safe products. Therefore, spacesuit zippers must be able to bear a tensile force of 2,000 newtons, while the average zippers can hold only 760 newtons. Besides, spacesuit zippers should never get stuck.Photo shows an SBS zipper entering the space with China\'s Shenzhou manned spaceship. (Photo from ijjnews.com)To manufacture reliable zippers for spacesuits, SBS sought support from universities and research institutions for product verification and digital simulation. It developed specialized equipment for the making of spacesuit zippers and optimized relevant parts. Under these efforts, it completed millions of tests and improvements in materials and techniques and finally developed products that meet the standard of space missions.The progress mirrors the entrepreneurial spirit of SBS, which encourages the company to promote enterprise-university-research institution integration and pursue innovation.Zippers are small. However, to manufacture them need over 100 procedures and involve more than 10 first-level disciplines and 40 second-level disciplines. Problems occurring in any procedure would impact the quality of products.It was because of the disciplines and technologies involved, enterprise-university-research institution collaboration became the priority of SBS when it worked for technological breakthroughs.An R&D staff member tests the physical performance of zippers in a lab of Chinese zipper manufacturer SBS in southeast China\'s Fujian province. (Photo from ijjnews.com)The hard raw materials of metal zippers would harm manufacturing equipment, so the universities in cooperation with SBS optimized the formulation of metals, which not only lowered production cost, but also lifted the quality of zippers.Metals are prone to corrosion in certain temperatures and pH range, which shortens the service life of zippers. To cope with this problem, research institutions assisted SBS to conduct tests of surface corrosion and helped it develop anti-corrosion technologies, so as to make its zippers more adaptive.Enterprises, as experienced market players, know well the demands of their clients. They play an important role in accelerating the commercialization of sci-tech outcomes.On one hand, enterprises\' own R&D teams can share supply-side information with universities and research institutions, so that the latter are able to find the correct direction of their research. On the other hand, enterprises, by fully exploiting market mechanisms, can significantly lower the risks of universities and research institutions in the application of sci-tech outcomes.Photo shows a workshop of Chinese zipper manufacturer SBS in southeast China\'s Fujian province. (Photo from ijjnews.com)Universities and research institutions are the source of innovative development, while enterprises build platforms for the translation, verification and feedback of technologies. Only when the two sides work together, can the resources for innovation be allocated more efficiently.Today, tech-ish and innovative products are emerging in the zipper industry. Some zippers are reflective in the dark, and some are equipped with the near-field communication technology, which combine such functions as online interaction, mobile payment and electronic ticket services.As the textile and garment industry faces increasingly diverse and individualized demands, many Chinese zipper manufacturers are building a stronger sci-tech foundation to cope with the fierce market competition.Practice proves that boosting the principal role of enterprises in innovation, enhancing the enterprise-led collaboration among enterprises, universities and research institutions, and improving technological transformation and commercialization will lead traditional industries toward a wider path of innovation.', 'technology', '2023-07-05', 'By Li Tielin (People\'s Daily) 13:36, July 05, 2023', 'As China\'s Shenzhou-16 manned spaceship was recently launched, Fujian Xunxing Zipper Science & Techn', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039927.html');

(Photo/Wen Xinghua)There\'s a 2,712 km railway in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It crosses desert, the Gobi, and no man\'s land and stretches in scorching heat, sand storms and extreme coldness. It connects multiple places in five prefectures in southern Xinjiang and serves millions of people of various ethnic groups. Because of it, many remote cities have had access to railway services for the first time.It is the rail loop line that encircles the Taklamakan, China\'s largest desert. As the world\'s first desert rail loop line, the railway was completed after the new Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line was linked with the Ruoqiang-Korla section of the Golmud-Korla railway line, and the Korla-Kashgar and Kashgar-Hotan sections of the southern Xinjiang rail line in June last year.\"It was totally impossible to get cargos to Tibet in three days,\" said Huang Wei, general manager of a coal mining company in Xinjiang, adding that it took over 10 days before the Golmud-Korla railway line was put into service.Now, the loop line has further facilitated transportation, which helps broaden the sales channel of his products, the man added.The Golmud-Korla railway line is an important part of the loop line encircling the Taklamakan. It handles over 95 percent of the cargos in southern Xinjiang. From a line that connects Qinghai province and Tibet autonomous region, it has grown into a logistics artery that links Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and contributes to the economic development of west China.Today, carpets from Hotan, plums from Kashgar and apples from Aksu are being sent to various parts of China with a much faster speed.According to statistics, since the loop line was put into operation, freight transport centers in Korla and Kashgar have shipped nearly 33.5 million tons of cargos by the middle of this June.A train runs on the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. (Photo/Wen Xinghua)The loop line has for the first time brought railway services to Lop, Qira, Yutian, Minfeng, Qiemo and other places in southern Xinjiang, facilitating local residents of various ethnic groups.It is learned that the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line has witnessed more than 360,000 passenger trips in the past year, and trains were kept full almost every day.At around 1:00 pm, Train 5818 was about to depart from Hotan. Attendant Mihray Mesawur retracted a bridge plate after receiving the order of departure and closed the door of a car. As the train blew its whistle, buildings outside the window started moving backwards and were gradually replaced by desert.Mihray Mesawur was born in Qira county, Hotan. Before the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line was put into operation, the county had no access to railway.The woman said that she had to spend 2 hours on bus and then take the train to go to work in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.\"Now I can go to the city by taking Train 5818,\" she noted.Tursuntohti Aminniyaz told People\'s Daily that it was the first time for him to take a train. \"I\'m going to Urumqi first and then Savan county. I have relatives there who told me I could probably get a decent job there,\" he said.Photo shows the Yutian train station in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. (Photo/Wen Xinghua)When the train passed Yutian, it was all desert outside the windows. However, there were grass grids and a green corridor about tens of meters wide along the tracks. According to a railway worker, the greenery was designed to protect the railway from sandstorms.The grass grids cover an area of 50 million square meters along the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line, which is also lined with 7,600 hectares of artificial trees. This effectively protects the railway and improves the ecology on both sides of the railway.Train 5818 arrived at the Minfeng railway station at 4:58 pm. About 186 km of the 264 km section north from the station was located in desert. That\'s why passengers always feel there are fine sands in their mouths.The number of days with sandstorms exceeds 200 each year there, said Zhong Dingjun, a chief engineer in Kashgar, adding that the high roadbeds, long and high bridges, as well as high tunnels were all built to make way for sand in case it buries the tracks.Apart from manual inspection, big data technology is also applied to ensure the stable operation of the desert rail loop line. For example, with the help of track geometry cars, as well as vehicle-mounted circuit checkers that collects gauge width and height, targeted maintenance can be carried out.\"They can find out a variation as small as 5 mm in track height,\" said Zhong.The desert rail loop line is injecting vitality into the economic and social development in southern Xinjiang, carrying the aspiration of the people along its route for a better life.', 'XinJiang', '2023-07-05', 'By Jiang Yunlong, Li Ya\'nan (People\'s Daily) 13:45, July 05, 2023', 'A train runs on the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039939.html');

It is the first time a Chinese nurse has won the prestigious global award.However, it was not the first time that Zhang was lauded by the medical community. Twenty years ago, Zhang was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal.Born in 1929 into a wealthy family in the eastern Chinese city of Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, Zhang once led a life of affluence and privilege. By chance, she read about Florence Nightingale, who devoted herself to the noble cause of nursing. Zhang then made the decision to leave behind her carefree life for a rewarding career as a nurse.In 1951, she began her decades-long nursing mission. Even after her retirement in 1992, Zhang was unable to stop thinking of those in need of care.In 1999, she called upon her colleagues to help her establish a volunteer nursing service center in Jiangxi, which was in 2002 named the Jiangxi Red Cross volunteer nursing service center. It provides care services at the community level for vulnerable people in need of medical aid.In 2010, Zhang started a volunteer group named after Nightingale in Nanchang, and four years later she registered another volunteer group named after herself. Today, nearly 20,000 volunteers provide free care services under Zhang\'s guidance.Several volunteer nurses in their 70s and 80s are very familiar with Zhang\'s work style. According to senior volunteers, Zhang\'s rigid requirements and demands for accuracy in their work illustrate how she remains responsible for her patients. Nurses and volunteers are asked to clean bed pans before putting them on shelves and to examine patients prone to bedsores regularly.Hu Junjie, 21, recalled how Zhang and her team aided his father in muscle recovery and how they applied medicine many years ago. Hu is a postgraduate student at Wuhan University in central China\'s Hubei Province, and now volunteers with Zhang\'s teams every break between semesters.\"I have grown up under the care and help of my nurse grannies. How could I not join them to help more people?\" Hu said, noting that his current research at the university concerns the application of artificial intelligence in medical services.Zhang\'s selfless devotion to nursing has made her a grandmother to many, and her own family is supportive of the difficult and time-consuming career she has chosen. \"My grandma doesn\'t know how to cook or do housework at all. But she has devoted her all to the noble cause of helping others.

Don\'t dump polluted water into the sea,\" and \"No discharge without consent. Keep your promise to the fishermen!\"Two South Korean media outlets reported on Tuesday that Japan inked a \"black deal\" with the IAEA to \"redact\" the sensitive issues mentioned in its final report, citing anonymous informants.Obtained documents supported allegations that the Japanese government provided the IAEA with at least 1 million euros to get a draft of the IAEA final report ahead of its official delivery and demanded it is redacted in sensitive parts, the Tamsa and the Mindlenews told a joint press conference with foreign correspondents.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday that the Chinese side regrets the hasty release of the report, noting that the ministry learned that the report failed to fully reflect views from experts that participated in the review, and the conclusion was not shared by all experts.Due to its limited mandate, the IAEA failed to review the justification and legitimacy of Japan\'s ocean discharge plan, assess the long-term effectiveness of Japan\'s purification facility and corroborate the authenticity and accuracy of Japan\'s nuclear-contaminated water data. Therefore, the conclusion is largely limited and incomplete, the spokesperson said.Also on Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Japan told a press conference held in Tokyo that the IAEA report does not necessarily greenlight the Japanese government\'s discharge plan, adding that the report cannot prove the legitimacy and legality of Japan\'s ocean discharge plan, nor can it absolve Japan of its moral responsibility and obligations under international law.\"We once again urge the Japanese side to stop its ocean discharge plan, and earnestly dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, safe and transparent manner,\" the embassy said, adding that no matter what the report says, it will not change the fact that Japan will release millions of tonnes of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific in the next three decades.', 'IAEA discharge Japans Fukushima release nuclear-contaminated', '2023-07-05', ' (Xinhua) 15:49, July 05, 2023', 'TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- With a final safety review report on Japan\'s plan to release nuclear-conta', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0705/c90000-20040155.html');

With a stable year-round chili cultivation area of over 133,000 hectares, it ranks first among all prefecture-level cities in the country.The Chili City, which evolved from the local markets of Xiazi Township in the 1970s, officially commenced operations in August 2017.

The village has 61 B&B hotels with over 1,860 rooms. During holidays and festivals, the occupancy rate approaches 95 percent. The flourishing B&B industry in Bohou has also created jobs for nearby villagers.Maona village, a Li ethnic village located at the foot of Wuzhishan Mountain in Wuzhishan city, has been promoting rural tourism by leveraging its sound ecology and Li culture. The village received 58,800 tourist visits in 2022, with tourism revenue exceeding 2.94 million yuan, up 245.48 percent year on year.Meanwhile, Hainan has built multiple high-quality business blocks featuring rich culture, including the Qilou Old Street in Haikou city. A restoration project that aims to preserve the original style of this historical and cultural block and combine traditional culture with a modern-day lifestyle has turned it into a well-known hang-out for tourists.The cultural block is now home to specialty stores, B&B hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, and cultural and creative stores, and many stores of time-honored brands have opened there, according to Zhao Aihua, an expert responsible for the restoration project.\"I take a stroll at the Qilou Old Street almost every week.

The global expansion of the internet, in particular, has significantly enhanced opportunities for the remote provision of various services, including professional, business, audiovisual, education, distribution, financial and health-related services.It also found that India, another Asian country proficient in commercial services, has more than doubled its share of such exports in this category to 4.4 percent of the global total in 2022 from 2 percent in 2005.In contrast to goods trade, trade in services refers to the sale and delivery of intangible services such as transportation, finance, tourism, telecommunications, construction, advertising, computing and accounting.Despite a weakening demand for goods and geoeconomic fragmentation, China\'s trade in services flourished on the back of continuous opening-up, stable recovery of the services sector and ongoing digitalization. The value of the country\'s trade in services grew by 9.1 percent on a yearly basis to 2.08 trillion yuan ($287.56 billion) in the first four months, said the Ministry of Commerce.Experts said that segments like human capital-intensive services, knowledge-intensive services and travel services — education, tourism, aircraft and vessel maintenance, TV and film production — have been particularly active in China in recent years.Zhang Wei, chief expert of the Shanghai-based China Association of Trade in Services, said that future economic growth in China can be driven by growing exports of human capital-intensive services, which demand a higher level of expertise and skill. These services encompass areas such as technology consulting, research and development, and engineering.China\'s trade in knowledge-intensive services expanded 13.1 percent year-on-year to 905.79 billion yuan between January and April. The figure accounted for 43.5 percent of the country\'s total volume of services trade, up 1.5 percentage points from the same period in 2022, said the Ministry of Commerce.\"Another contributing factor to the national economy will be growing demand for high-quality foreign services from the expanding middle-income population in China,\" Zhang said, adding that these services may cover domains such as education, logistics, tourism, healthcare and entertainment.Foreign service trade providers said that they remain optimistic about the outlook for the industry this year and beyond in the Chinese market.The zero and low tariff rates brought by the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership pact and other free trade deals will boost consumers\' purchasing power and enable small and medium-sized enterprises to ship more products to other signatory countries, said Eddy Chan, senior vice-president of United States-based FedEx Express and president of FedEx China.This trend will definitely generate more growth points for cross-border service trade providers, he said.Dekra Group, a German testing, inspection and certification group with more than 48,000 employees globally, will expand its laboratory space in Hefei, Anhui province this year, to serve the fast-growing information technology, household appliances and electric vehicle industries in China\'s eastern region.Many opportunities come from China\'s pursuit of sustainable growth and rapid industrial upgrading pace, said Mike Walsh, executive vice-president of Dekra and the group\'s head of the Asia-Pacific region.', 'services the trade making global mark its percent said China', '2023-07-06', 'By ZHONG NAN (China Daily) 08:26, July 06, 2023', 'China has expanded its share of global commercial services exports from 3 percent in 2005 to 5.4 per', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040278.html');

(Xinhua/Zhang Xiaoyu)BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The report on the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station released by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) cannot justify or legitimize Japan\'s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean, nor should the report be the \"shield\" or \"greenlight\" for it, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Wednesday.Wang made the remarks at a regular press briefing when asked to comment on IAEA\'s report. He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, China Atomic Energy Authority and the National Nuclear Safety Administration have made clear China\'s strong position.\"China\'s position is based on science and facts. I would like to stress again that the report should not be the \'shield\' or \'greenlight\' for Japan\'s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean,\" Wang said.He said that firstly, the report cannot justify Japan\'s plan of discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. The Japanese side unilaterally decided to dump the water into the ocean, which is in fact minimizing its own costs and risks while letting the world take nuclear contamination risks that could have been avoided. The report clearly pointed out that the IAEA provides neither a recommendation nor an endorsement of Japan\'s ocean discharge plan.\"Second, the report cannot give legitimacy to Japan\'s plan of discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean,\" he said, adding that by discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese side may violate obligations stipulated in international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter in 1972.\"Since Japan claims that it abides by international law and rules, it owes the international community an explanation,\" Wang added.Third, the report cannot ensure the safety of Japan\'s plan of discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. The effectiveness and long-term reliability of Japan\'s purification facility are not verified by a third party, the authenticity and accuracy of the nuclear-contaminated water data lacks proof, and the long-term influence of radionuclides in the nuclear-contaminated water on food safety and people\'s health through biological concentration has not been studied, Wang said.Fourth, the report cannot ensure the effectiveness of the monitoring arrangement. Wang said that Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the nuclear power plant\'s operator, has tampered with or held back nuclear-contaminated water data for many times. In IAEA\'s plan, the monitoring arrangement does not include independent sampling and takes TEPCO\'s data and information as the basis of monitoring. \"Such practice is inadvisable,\" he said.\"Facts have shown that the report did not resolve the strong opposition against ocean discharge both in Japan and the rest of the world,\" Wang said.He quoted results from relevant surveys, saying that according to the latest survey in Japan, 40 percent of Japanese oppose ocean discharge, and according to a joint survey by South Korean Hankook Ilbo and Japan\'s Yomiuri Shimbun newspapers, over 80 percent of ROK people disapprove of Japan\'s discharge of nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean.Experts and people in the Pacific Island countries, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Africa, Peru and other countries protested and voiced their opposition. The Chinese people have strong concerns over Japan\'s discharge plan. Competent departments of the Chinese government will enhance marine environment monitoring and strengthen inspection and quarantine of imported seafood and other products to safeguard people\'s health and food safety, said Wang.According to reports, the Japanese government plans to start the ocean discharge process as early as this August.Japan\'s planned ocean discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water bears on major international public interest. \"The stakes are too high. We cannot afford to ignore risks that might lead to a mishap,\" Wang said.\"We urge Japan to respect science and facts, not attempt to use the IAEA report to shield its ocean discharge, faithfully fulfill its moral responsibility and obligations under international law, stop pushing forward the ocean discharge plan, and dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a responsible manner,\" the spokesperson said. ', 'nuclear-contaminated discharge Japans justify data He discha', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 08:27, July 06, 2023', 'This photo taken on March 6, 2023 shows the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant seen from Futabac', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040282.html');

File Photo (Xinhua/Yin Bogu)As US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to arrive in Beijing on Thursday to kick off a long-awaited visit, many in China are watching the latest round of talks between Chinese and US officials with mixed feelings, with businesses and analysts welcoming the trip while remaining cautious over the potential breakthroughs it could achieve.At the heart of such mixed feelings is the question of the US\' sincerity in not only pursuing productive communication with China, but also earnestly addressing each other\'s core concerns, experts noted. To many Chinese, US officials, including Yellen, have repeatedly stated they do not seek to decouple from China or contain China, but their actions, that range from lingering tariffs on Chinese goods to blatant crackdowns on Chinese firms and strict restrictions of high-tech supplies, show the exact opposite.Facing such a two-faced approach by Washington, China is well-prepared to respond in kind by maintaining communication with US officials, while also taking necessary measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests against US aggression, industry insiders and experts said, pointing to the recent announcement of export controls on two metals crucial for the making of chips and other high-tech components.Cautious expectationsYellen is due to arrive in China on Thursday and will visit through Sunday, during which she is expected to meet senior Chinese officials. The trip has garnered widespread global attention as talks between Chinese and US officials in recent months have increased. It comes just weeks after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken\'s visit to China, and as the world faces serious challenges from an economic downturn and debt distresses to climate change, which all require cooperation between the world\'s two biggest economies.\"I can\'t say anything about \'expectations,\' but the hope is that there will be some relaxation [in tensions] between China and the US, including trade, finance, technology and even business exchanges, especially in the current situation where the global economy is under pressure,\" an insider in the Chinese mechanical and electrical industry who is closely involved in businesses in the US told the Global Times on Wednesday.Such low expectations are shared by many, including apparently US officials. \"No major breakthroughs are expected, but Yellen will push to open new lines of communication and coordination on economic matters, and stress the consequences of supplying lethal aid to Russia,\" US officials said, Reuters reported on Wednesday.Citing US National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin, Reuters reported that the trip \"won\'t end $360 billion in tariffs imposed under former president Donald Trump, or export controls that have gathered steam under [US President Joe Biden].\"While those thorny issues are not expected to be addressed through a single trip, there should be talks at least on how to address them, as they remain sticking points in the bilateral economic and trade relationship that prevent any meaningful improvement in bilateral ties, analysts said. The US\' failure to demonstrate a willingness to address these issues also lays bare the US\' insincerity, they further pointed out.Lack of credibility\"If the US is to show its sincerity, it must do so by adopting concrete policies, such as lowering tariffs with China, relaxing restrictions on investment in China, and so on,\" Hu Qimu, deputy secretary general of the digital real economies integration Forum 50, told the Global Times.However, as US officials have been saying one thing yet doing the exact opposite, \"public statements by US politicians do not have any credibility,\" Hu said, adding that the \"biggest achievement\" of the trip is likely to be that both sides are still talking.Yellen, who is widely viewed by Chinese analysts as a pragmatic economic official, has been vocal about cutting US tariffs on Chinese exports and avoiding decoupling. In 2022, she said that lowering US tariffs on Chinese goods was \"worth considering\" given its \"desirable effects\" on lower US inflation. Last month, she warned that \"it would be disastrous for us to attempt to decouple from China,\" adding that \"I certainly do not think it is in our interest to stifle the economic progress of the Chinese people.\"However, growing signals, including from the US Treasury Department, portend that Yellen will likely largely repeat the same talking points as previous US officials have. In a media advisory about the trip on Sunday, the department reiterated three principles guiding the US economic relationship with China laid out by Yellen in April. They include securing the US\' and its allies\' national security interests and protecting human rights, seeking a healthy economic relationship with China, and cooperating on global challenges.Analysts noted that \"securing national security and protecting human rights\" have become a catch-all pretext for the US to launch economic, trade and technological crackdowns against China.Under such pretexts, the US Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on Chinese entities and individuals, and there should be a discussion on their removal, said Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. \"If the US wants to show its sincerity, it must first match its words with deeds,\" Gao told the Global Times on Wednesday.However, that might be hard to achieve, as Yellen, during her speech in April, stated that securing US national security and protecting human rights \"are areas where we will not compromise.\"China has made clear that it will firmly safeguard its own national security and interests, though the difference is that China\'s national security and interests are actually threatened by constant US crackdowns and sanctions. On Monday, China announced export controls on gallium and germanium, which are critical for the making of chips and other high-tech components. Chinese officials maintained that the move is to protect China\'s national security and interests, but it has been widely viewed as a response to West\'s restrictions on chips and other supplies.Foreign media outlets have linked the move to Yellen\'s trip. Chinese analysts said that while there is no direct link, it shows that China will firmly safeguard its own national security and interests against the US-led West\'s aggression, while keeping lines of communication open with the US and even pursuing cooperation in areas where they can.During the trip, \"it cannot be ruled that the two sides can make some progress in the area of financial and macroeconomic policies,\" Gao said, noting that both sides share a common interest in coordinating macroeconomic policies.Or at least that is the hope of many in the financial industry. \"I hope that Yellen\'s visit to China will help the two countries increase macro-policy coordination and jointly deal with the financial risks facing the world,\" a senior financial professional at a Beijing-based firm told the Global Times on Wednesday.', 'address Chinas concerns urged visit officials security that ', '2023-07-06', ' (Global Times) 08:31, July 06, 2023', 'Janet Yellen.

Thanks to this campaign, more than 1,300 companies in diverse sectors including computer software, finance and electronics have offered over 11,000 job openings.The centrally-administered state-owned enterprise on human resource services forged cooperation with nearly 100 universities to hold exclusive campus recruitment activities in the first half of the year.During the same period, the company also organized 162 online job fairs, attracting around 41,000 enterprises to advertise 175,000 positions.In order to encourage companies to hire young jobseekers, China has rolled out a subsidy policy for firms that hire young people who graduated from universities within the last two years, as well as candidates aged between 16 and 24 who have filed for unemployment.Effective till the end of this year, the policy will grant the companies a one-off subsidy of no more than 1,500 yuan (about 208.43 U.S. dollars) for each young jobseeker they hire.As of May, the number of young people aged between 16 and 24 in China had exceeded 96 million, and over 33 million of them have entered the labor market, according to Fu Linghui, spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics.Among these young jobseekers, over 26 million have found jobs while some 6 million are still looking for work.\"With the economy continuing to improve, there will be solid support for the employment situation to remain generally stable,\" the spokesperson said.Other human resource services companies have been focusing on supporting rural labor forces and disabled people, helping them find jobs and learn new skills.China Strait Talent Market has set up 46 offices in Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia and other regions with relatively large rural labor forces, and has trained more than 5,000 people in professional skills and entrepreneurship.A human resource service group based in Sichuan has set up a service network connecting governments, enterprises and people with disability and it has served 7,000 people with disabilities to date.Flexible employment, which includes individual businesses, part-time jobs and new types of employment, is becoming increasingly important in broadening new employment channels and relieving employment pressure.China has been bolstering its support for flexible employment by implementing a range of channels and measures aimed at safeguarding the rights and interests of individuals engaged in such work arrangements.GaiaWorks, a workforce management system developer headquartered in Suzhou, has established a workforce management cloud platform, matching over 300 companies with 40,000 gig-work jobseekers. ', 'employment relieving stabilize efforts The steps and compani', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 08:35, July 06, 2023', 'A college graduate reads recruitment information at a job fair in Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonom', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040315.html');

They all came to seek acupuncture treatment by the Chinese medical professionals.Since the arrival of the Chinese medical staff, acupuncture therapy based on traditional Chinese medicine has gained popularity increasingly across the Pacific island country, with its effect winning widespread recognition from local residents.\"I have visited the acupuncture treatment for six days now. Today will be my seventh day and I think I am in a 10-day program. For the last six treatments, I feel very much different,\" Rex Foukona told Xinhua.\"Before I came here, my headache took me eight hours (a day) and I tried some medical treatments to relieve me. Their presence here is what we need, what we very much need in this country, \" said Foukona.\"It is a new kind of treatment. It is really good,\" he noted.Another patient, Martin Popot, who previously suffered from great pain in his legs, said that the Chinese acupuncture has helped him a lot.\"If I walked for a few minutes or too long, I started to feel there was heat under my legs and there were sort of things through my veins that were so painful that I couldn\'t walk, so I needed to rest for about five to 10 minutes before standing up and walking again,\" he recalled.\"I really appreciate the doctors. They are very professional in what they are doing. They are very punctual, they are very kind, and they are very good to Solomon Islanders,\" said Popot.Listed by the United Nations as one of the world\'s least-developed countries, the Solomon Islands has less than ideal health infrastructure. In primary-level or regional clinics, there are only nurses and nursing assistants available to treat patients, while doctors can just be found at provincial hospitals.After the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations in 2019, China started to dispatch medical team including doctors and nurses to the Solomon Islands in early 2022. Currently, the second batch of eight Chinese medical team members are working here.George Wilson Malefoasi, CEO of the National Referral Hospital, told Xinhua that it is a milestone to have acupuncture as a formal treatment in the hospital.\"One of the benefits of having acupuncture is that it is cost-effective. There are limited resources.

A suspect is in custody, local media reported.At least two juveniles were among those shot, but their conditions were not immediately known.In another mass shooting incident early Sunday, two people were killed and 28 others injured in Baltimore, the most populous city in the state of Maryland.An 18-year-old female was pronounced deceased on scene, and a 20-year-old male was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later, according to the Baltimore Police Department.\"This tragedy again shows why we must continue to focus on the number of illegal guns on our streets that make it into the hands of individuals who should not have them and continuously carry out violent acts in our city,\" said Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott.NATIONAL OUTCRYIt was not the first time ravaging gun violence cast a pall over U.S. Independence Day. As gun-related death rates continue to rise each year in the United States, Americans increasingly see gun violence as an issue of national concern.Over the past decade, the country has encountered five mass shootings each Independence Day on average -- more than on any other day of the year, USA Today reported last week.This year\'s holiday came as the United States grapples with historically elevated levels of gun violence, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic.So far this year, there have been at least 341 mass shootings across the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The nonprofit group defines a mass shooting as an incident where at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.Seven out of 10 Americans say crime is \"out of control\" in the United States, according to a June USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll of 1,000 residents.The San Francisco Chronicle reported that over the weekend of June 17-18, gun violence ravaged the United States, including at least 60 shots in the Chicago area alone.That weekend also witnessed four people shot dead in the small town of Kellogg, Idaho. A Pennsylvania state trooper was slain and a second critically wounded after an ambush at a police barracks by a man, who was then killed in a gun battle.Poverty, unemployment and an inadequate social safety net have left many angry and alienated, leading relationships to fray and tensions to flare, said UC Berkeley law Professor Jonathan Simon, adding that escalations of assaults and shootings can have ripple effects for years.A recent Pew Research study found that while views about gun ownership and gun policy remain starkly divided along party lines, a majority of 60 percent of Americans surveyed viewed gun violence as a \"very big\" national issue, up 7 percentage points from 2018.Debates over gun policy have waxed and waned in the United States over the years, as Democrats generally favor more gun control while most Republicans argue that gun rights should not be infringed upon.Those starkly divisive issues have triggered frequent mass shootings across American states and cities, deepening social divisions and raising human rights concerns.\"We have completely jumped the shark as a nation,\" David Axelrod, a renowned American political strategist and commentator, tweeted earlier in May.\"The world looks at us in absolute bewilderment as we slaughter each other with guns, and throw our hands up in resignation,\" Axelrod wrote. \"It\'s pathetic.\" ', 'trooper flare violence shootings killed shooter Independence', '2023-07-06', 'By Xinhua writer Ma Qian (Xinhua) 10:20, July 06, 2023', 'WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Screams and cries at scenes of bloodshed drowned out the celebration', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040463.html');

U.S. media, including Bloomberg, gave quite positive coverage,\" said Kuhn.The second was Xi\'s five-day tour to the United States in early 2012 as vice president of China. Stopping in Los Angeles, Xi held a luncheon for over 100 leaders in entertainment, business and government, Kuhn said, adding that much of his speech stressed the importance of people-to-people connections between Chinese and Americans, which he reinforced by attending a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game.\"The third, in 2015, in preparation for President Xi\'s state visit to the United States, I was asked to travel to speak at a ceremony to dedicate the Sino-U.S. Friendship House in Muscatine, Iowa,\" said Kuhn.The house has come to symbolize the desire of common people for closer ties between China and the United States, because in 1985, Xi, then a young local official, stayed in the same house as part of a delegation visiting Iowa to learn agricultural techniques, Kuhn said. \"Xi had included a return visit to Muscatine, meeting with old friends, on his 2012 U.S. visit. We call it the \'Muscatine Spirit.\'\"The fourth, in the middle years of the last decade, was when Kuhn was first following the rapid developments in the BRI.\"I noted in the media that although the BRI was about large infrastructure and industrial connectivity, Xi included in BRI objectives people-to-people connectivity. This exemplified, I said at the time, that Xi sees people as foundational, infrastructure as instrumentational,\" said Kuhn.The fifth, in December 2018, at the 40th anniversary of China\'s reform and opening-up, was when Kuhn was among the 10 foreigners to receive the China Reform Friendship Medal.\"After awarding me the medal, President Xi said that facilitating China\'s communications with the world is essential, so that foreigners can come to know the real China.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Opinion: U.S. nuclear policy fueling global instability and uncertainty - People\'s Daily Online', 'In January 2022, the five nuclear-armed countries (China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France) issued a joint statement emphasizing the need to prevent nuclear war and avoid arms races.While stressing that nuclear weapons should only serve defensive purposes, they reiterated the importance of non-proliferation agreements and commitments.However, the actual U.S. policies, such as those aimed at reinforcing strategic forward-basing, strengthening space-based missile defense capabilities and transferring high-risk materials, have run counter to the spirit of the statement, which severely undermined global stability and non-proliferation efforts, causing deep concern among those who care about world peace and security.IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIONSExpectations were high for the Biden administration to rectify U.S. nuclear policy, as Joe Biden had emphasized during his campaign that nuclear weapons would only be used to deter nuclear attacks.However, the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review report revealed that it continued the path set by the Trump administration, focusing on strengthening non-strategic nuclear forces and developing tactical nuclear weapons.Under its nuclear policy, a series of irresponsible actions have significantly increased the risk of nuclear conflict.A notable example is the Washington Declaration issued during Biden\'s meeting with South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, where they decided to establish a new nuclear consultation group and deploy nuclear submarines to the Korean Peninsula in response to the so-called \"extended deterrence.\"It is worth noting that this marked the first time in over 40 years that the United States deployed strategic nuclear submarines to South Korea.At the end of 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense announced the deployment of six B-52 strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear warheads at Royal Australian Air Force Base Tindal.Such reinforcement of strategic nuclear forward-basing further indicates that the United States still views nuclear weapons as key elements for seeking battlefield advantage rather than solely as a last-resort deterrent measure.In addition, the United States has been hyping up the so-called \"Chinese nuclear threat\" in disregard of China\'s commitment to the \"no first use\" policy, blatantly tailoring deterrence against China specifically based on its tactical nuclear weapons including the B61-12.Framing China as a nuclear threat is nothing but a ridiculous excuse by the United States, who is trying to divert attention from its own actions and further contain China.Moreover, the United States has been touting its Indo-Pacific strategy and creating camp confrontations in the region, coercing allies into binding their security strategies with the United States.Coupled with its dangerous U.S. nuclear strategy, this greatly increases the risk of regional conflicts and nuclear confrontation.VIOLATE NON-PROLIFERATIONThe United States will assist Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines and transfer highly enriched uranium to Australia under the trilateral AUKUS alliance, which marks the first time that a nuclear weapon state help a non-nuclear weapon state gain nuclear capability.To obviate the need of refueling and improve operational readiness, U.S. nuclear submarines are equipped with weapons-grade highly enriched uranium, which can lead to nuclear detonation once it exceeds the critical mass.Under the AUKUS agreement in March, the United States will sell at least three nuclear submarines to Australia, and through joint cooperation, Australia aims to possess eight nuclear submarines by 2055.This means that Australia could offload about two tons of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium from its eight nuclear submarines, equivalent to 80 nuclear warheads.This has unprecedentedly violated the principles and practices of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, undermining the international non-proliferation regime and the International Atomic Energy Agency\'s (IAEA) safeguards system.Disregarding the basic principles of the IAEA, AUKUS countries try to invoke Article 14 of the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement to bypass verification and make safeguards exemption arrangements.However, this approach coercively imposes arrangements without considering the divergent interpretations and applicability of Article 14 within the international community.No countries or institutions has the right to unilaterally take the matter of the applicability of this Article or strike deals and impose them on the entire membership.The actions of the United States, though hosting Nuclear Security Summits since 2010 for four consecutive times focused on non-proliferation, are contradictory.By proliferating nuclear capabilities to other countries, it undermines the spirit and rules of nuclear non-proliferation.The IAEA\'s verification aims to prevent any country from accumulating nuclear weapons potential, regardless of their stated intentions.Trust is not a substitute for supervision. Using Australia\'s non-proliferation record as an excuse for the AUKUS, particularly by the United States, tramples on the principles of nuclear non-proliferation and violates established rules.SHIFTING RHETORICThe changing rhetoric of U.S. nuclear policy over the years suggests that it is struggling to maintain its dominant position in the nuclear field.The 1999 U.S. National Missile Defense Act stipulates that the United States should deploy a limited national missile defense system. The word \"limited\" implies that there should be restrictions on the scale of U.S. countermeasure capability.Even though the Bush administration withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, the United States still maintained the commitment that its homeland missile defense is not targeted at China and Russia.However, the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 revised it to remove the word \"limited,\" and the 2018 NDAA authorized expansions in the national missile defense program, which means that it overturned previous commitments to limit the size of its own capabilities of anti-ballistic missiles and not to target China and Russia.Under the Trump administration, U.S. missile defense capabilities were directed against perceived threats from Russia and China, including the emphasis on space-based missile defense.While emphasizing the threat from China and Russia, the Biden administration has invested heavily in so-called \"The Next Generation Interceptor,\" including projects like Starshield utilizing advanced satellite technology by SpaceX.The Starshield project utilizes the Starlink technology and its launch capabilities to provide \"hosted payloads (the ability to put a wide variety of instruments on the Starshield satellite bus).\" And the second-generation Starlink satellites weigh over one ton, making them capable of carrying interceptor payloads for multiple interceptions of ballistic missiles launched from anywhere in the world.This has sparked concern about a potential return to an arms race reminiscent of the \"Star Wars\" era.To mitigate such concerns and foster trust, the United States should take substantive actions and provide transparent and credible commitments regarding the intentions and limitations of its missile defense systems, and provide reassurances to China, Russia and other nations to dispel strategic suspicions.By doing so, the likelihood of an arms race scenario can be reduced, and international stability can be maintained.When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. In the eyes of a country driven by competition, everything looks like a zero-sum game. In the eyes of an arrogant nation, everything must be resolved through confrontation and conflict.Only by upholding the common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept and sticking to a win-win approach can we eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, and bring stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era.In the nuclear field, all nuclear-armed states should abandon Cold War mentality and zero-sum games, and adhere to the principles and norms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Only in this way can we effectively reduce the risk of nuclear war and any military conflicts between nuclear-armed states, and truly promote lasting peace and security worldwide.Editor\'s note: Liu Chong is the director of Institute of International Security Studies at China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations and a council member of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association.The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Xinhua News Agency.', 'non-proliferation ACTIONS tons submarines satellite tactical', '2023-07-06', 'By Liu Chong (Xinhua) 10:36, July 06, 2023', 'In January 2022, the five nuclear-armed countries (China, Russia, the United States, Britain and Fra', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040485.html');

However, due to the limitations on seabed observation, the deep structure of the South China Sea has been poorly understood, according to researchers from the Shenzhen-based Southern University of Science and Technology.The research team from the university used the data from a passive seismic experiment using ocean bottom seismometers, together with the land stations, to determine the high-resolution, three-dimensional seismic structure of the southwest sub-basin of the South China Sea.The researchers discovered that there is an anomaly area at a depth of 40 to 80 km in the south of the basin with an obvious low seismic shear velocity, and the anomaly is most apparent at a depth of about 50 km, according to a research article published in the journal Nature Communications.After deep thermodynamic and rock geochemical analysis, they obtained the geophysical evidence that the upper mantle in the southern South China Sea is relatively rich in water, and revealed the north-south asymmetry of the seismic wave velocity structure in the deep South China Sea.The study is of great significance in revealing the deep structure of subducting plates, the genesis of many volcanoes and reefs in the South China Sea, and the water cycle in the earth subduction zone, according to the researchers. ', 'structure deep Seas advances research seismic Researchers ve', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 10:41, July 06, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from a Chinese university have made breakthroughs in the stu', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 13:17:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040490.html');

Urban traffic management has been improved, which brings better traveling experiences to passengers.Citizens take autopilot buses in north China\'s Tianjin municipality. (People\'s Daily Online/Zhou Wei)Internet of vehicles is an interconnection function accessing the network for in-vehicle devices through wireless communication technology. With the internet of vehicles, dynamic information about vehicles can be uploaded to online platforms and then provided various services when running on the roads.It is mainly applied in pilot assist, autopilot, and intelligent traffic management.The internet of vehicles can effectively improve people\'s traveling experiences. An executive of Chinese carmaker BYD told People\'s Daily that the company\'s internet of vehicles products today feature all-scenario applications.Before getting into a BYD vehicle, the owner can remotely unlock the car, control the air conditioning, disinfect the interior, and check the status of the vehicle on a mobile application. BYD vehicles come with rich pilot assist functions that make driving easier under multiple scenarios, and offer various entertainment services when they are parked.Besides, users can lock the vehicles on mobile phones and check vehicle information anytime and anywhere after leaving the cars.Autopilot has constantly expanded its application scenarios, which not only facilitates the daily life of people, but also improves traffic efficiency. Today, many express parcel delivery vehicles, street sweepers and sightseeing buses are unmanned, running on both enclosed roads in parks and open streets in cities.Photo shows a smart city dispatching center in Ganzhou, east China\'s Jiangxi province. (People\'s Daily Online/Zhong Wanshan)It is also employed by container trucks in port areas. For instance, containers at a terminal in the Taicang port in east China\'s Jiangsu province, after being lifted by automatic quay cranes, are carried by autopilot container trucks to their destinations along the driving routes measured by the system.The intelligent transportation system enabled by the internet of vehicles is forcefully driving the construction of smart cities. Jiangsu\'s Wuxi city has built a national comprehensive testing center for intelligent traffic, which, based on traffic management data collected by the police, reminds drivers of vehicle illegal processing, urban roadblock information, as well as safety and emergency warning.In Suzhou of Jiangsu province, passengers getting off high-speed trains can board autopilot buses immediately after exiting the train station, or order unmanned taxis on mobile applications.According to statistics released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), 7 million intelligent connected vehicles with pilot assist systems were sold in China last year, up 45.6 percent year-on-year. During the same period, 48 percent of new energy vehicles in the country were equipped with pilot assist systems.The Chinese market of intelligent vehicles may hit nearly 1 trillion yuan ($138.65 billion) by 2025, said a white paper issued by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.In April this year, the MIIT announced to build national pilot zones of the internet of vehicles in Xiangyang of central China\'s Hubei province, Deqing of east China\'s Zhejiang province and Liuzhou of south China\'s Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. So far, China has approved seven such pilot zones, including the previously unveiled ones in Jiangsu, Tianjin, Hunan and Chongqing.A vehicle goes through an emergency braking test in a testing field for intelligent connected vehicles in Deqing, Huzhou, east China\'s Zhejiang province. (People\'s Daily Online/Wang Shucheng)The internet of vehicles system in the pilot zone of Wuxi is able to alert drivers to puddles and ice on roads with situation awareness technology and vehicle-mounted sensors, which improves traffic safety. In Wuxi\'s high-tech district, two routes have been designated for autopilot logistics, which benefit major enterprises and are connected to local unmanned factories.The pilot zone in Tianjin, a municipality with a well-built industrial chain of the automobile sector, has taken the lead to establish a service system for the development of the internet of vehicles and explore the commercial application modes. It has grown into a world-class pilot zone that combines R&D, testing and commercialization of the internet of vehicles.The national pilot zones of the internet of vehicles have been expanded, releasing a signal of China\'s accelerated layout of development of the internet of vehicles and the intelligent connected vehicle industry, said Feng Yi, director of the China Automotive Technology and Research Center.\"As an emerging business form, the internet of vehicles has become an important engine driving the high-quality development of the automobile industry,\" Feng added.Deputy head of the MIIT Xin Guobin said that China has, to date, designated over 15,000 km of roads for testing intelligent connected vehicles, and is also expanding the use of driverless taxis and buses, autonomous valet parking, and unmanned delivery vehicles.Besides, over 7,000 km of roads have been updated for intelligent connected vehicles with over 7,000 sets of roadside equipment in China\'s 17 national-level demonstration bases to test intelligent connected vehicles, 16 pilot cities for the coordinated development of smart city infrastructure and intelligent connected vehicles and seven national pilot zones of internet of vehicles.', 'vehicles', '2023-07-06', 'By Xu Peiyu (People\'s Daily) 11:04, July 06, 2023', 'Thanks to the rapid development of the new generation of information technologies, vehicles are gett', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 20:15:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040514.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('De-risking: I want your market, but you need to slow down tech development - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The talk of de-risking from China has been gaining ubiquity among Western politicians and business communities recently, while the de-coupling approach seems to be put away, at least in rhetoric.Don\'t get fooled. The nature of the new De-word is in fact to re-define risk and decouple from China in selective fields like high-tech and other key areas where those Western powers want to maintain their global dominance.For those who carefully craft and embrace such an approach in the United States and other major European capitals, the old way of total decoupling from the world\'s second largest economy has been proved impossible and immensely self-destructive. They still want to profit from China\'s mega market and rein in the country\'s rise at the same time.That is why they have chosen to walk back from the impossible, and tried to sell their new narrative without mentioning that this new approach, like the previous policy, is also going to rock the global supply chains, fragment the world economy and damage the prospects for common development around the world.WORD GAMEIn a statement following this year\'s Group of Seven (G7) Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, the G7 countries pledged to build economic resilience by \"diversifying and deepening partnerships and de-risking, not decoupling.\"State Secretary Antony Blinken explained \"there is a profound difference for the United States, and for many other countries, between \'de-risking\' and decoupling.\"In fact, before being \"redefined\" by the rich Western countries, \"de-risking\" was a financial term which referred to the phenomenon of financial institutions terminating or restricting business relationships with clients to avoid, rather than manage, risk. That\'s a situation where financial institutions practice excessive jurisdiction, and therefore, has long been criticized by the United States, the European Union (EU) and the World Bank.In April, the U.S. Department of Treasury still described \"de-risking\" as a practice \"not consistent with the risk-based approach,\" which \"undermines several key U.S. government policy objectives by driving financial activity out of the regulated financial system.\"However, in the past few months, the term, aggressively peddled around by some Western politicians, has become highly politicized. In a recent meeting in Brussels, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the EU does not intend to decouple or to turn inwards,\" while \"diplomatic de-risking was central to the bloc\'s approach.\"From \"decoupling\" to \"de-risking,\" the West\'s so-called \"minefield\" in its interactions with China remains the same. A May opinion piece in the Financial Times put the risks that the United States and the EU are worried about into two broad categories -- \"stuff the West gets from China\" such as new energy technology and critical minerals, and \"stuff that China gets from the West,\" including advanced technology with potential military use.Simply put: While fearing being held hostage by China on the demand side, Washington and its allies also fear being unable to hold China hostage on the supply side. These moves disregard the fact that interdependence is a natural result of economic globalization, and economic insecurity has nothing to do with their normal economic and trade exchanges with China.Gordon Flake, founding CEO of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, said that as \"decoupling is from anybody\'s perspective not realistic and is drastic,\" the Western policy is shifting towards decoupling from China in specific industries, enterprises, and even products and technologies.Meanwhile, under the guise of \"de-risking,\" the West continues forging ahead with its policy of protectionism.In an April speech at the Brookings Institution, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan pledged to protect U.S. \"foundational technologies with a small yard and high fence,\" while \"unapologetically\" pursuing their industrial strategy at home.Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, believed what is embedded in Sullivan\'s remarks, which peddled a \"technology blockade\" against China in the name of U.S. national security, were familiar neo-mercantilist themes.Whether it\'s called decoupling or \"de-risking,\" the United States is veering towards the wrong path of neo-mercantilism, he said.PARANOIA TO CONTAIN CHINAThe essence of the U.S. \"de-risking\" narrative is in fact to cut China\'s connection in key sectors with the world, hence maintaining its own hegemony. The word game simply shows the U.S. lack of capability to decouple from China, the panic and fear it faces due to competition from China, and a narrow-minded bias regarding different development paths.Josep Borrell, vice-president of the European Commission, said at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore: \"Every day, our trade with China is around 2.7 billion U.S. dollars. Every Day! So, decoupling? Forget about it. If we tried to do that, we would produce a worldwide crisis.\"Statistics show in 2022, the total trade in goods between China and the United States, China and the EU reached 690.6 billion dollars and 856.3 billion dollars respectively, both hitting a new high.As \"decoupling\" shows itself to be an unrealistic concept, the United States has to find a new narrative to replace it. \"De-risking\" became the viable choice, because on the one hand, it suits people\'s intention to avoid risk, and on the other it makes China the scapegoat as being \"the source of risk.\"Bates Gill, executive director of the Asia Society Policy Institute\'s Center for China Analysis, said: \"Who doesn\'t like reducing risks? It\'s just rhetorically a much smarter way of thinking about what needs to be done.\"Over the past decades, the economic development of China and the United States has shown sharp contrast. After over 40 years of reform and opening-up, China has now become the world\'s second-largest economy, the largest manufacturing hub, the largest trade of goods center, and the second-largest consumer market. Science and technology research and innovation have been constantly enhanced, the value chain keeps moving upwards, and China has been closing the gap with the United States in many areas such as 5G technology and green energy.At the same time, the U.S. economy has been experiencing industrial hollowing out, an Internet bubble, a sub-prime mortgage crisis, surging debt, and now a risk of depression.While China is becoming an important engine for world economic growth, America\'s \"competition panic\" keeps simmering. It now regards China as a \"competitor on all fronts\" that thus needs to be suppressed.In the eyes of the 48 Group Club\'s Chairman Stephen Perry, U.S. politicians have a tendency to blame others. \"I think that the Americans have found it easier to explain away the advances that China has made by demonizing China,\" Perry said.Fu Xiaolan, founding director of the Technology and Management Center for Development at the University of Oxford, said China has been using \"a combination of the state and the market to drive innovation and has integrated the country into the global innovation system,\" which has given fresh impetus to its economic development, setting an example for other countries.However, the United States, seeing itself as a \"beacon for freedom\" and a champion of opportunity, only endorses the rules and values beneficial to itself, and sees other non-American values as a challenge and security threat.As former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in his book \"Diplomacy,\" there is no other country like the United States stuck in the conviction that its institutions are universally viable. Thus, other cultures and ideologies should be altered.REAL RISKA market economy is, in fact, never without risks. While the West is pitching so-called \"risk control,\" chances are such a disruptive move may push risks \"out of control.\"\"Is the risk of losing trade in the future a good reason to avoid trading now, when the option is still available? One normally does not commit suicide to reduce the fear of death,\" former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said when questioning the notion of de-risking in his article \"The Risks of \'De-Risking\'\" on the website of the Project Syndicate.\"Over the years, U.S. businesses have really recognized the dual benefits of investing in China. They get more efficient production ... and they also get the opportunity to tap the world\'s richest and deepest market,\" Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, told the U.S. National Public Radio (NPR) on a show weeks ago. \"But those advantages are now slipping away as we focus on security,\" he added.Now, the risks from such a de-risking or decoupling are also being felt worldwide, and may further weigh on human progress.Economic globalization remains an inevitable trend of world development. China plays an important role in this system, its economic aggregate accounting for about 18 percent of the world\'s total and contributing over 30 percent to world economic growth on average in the decade from 2012 to 2021. The scale of its manufacturing industry has ranked first in the world for 13 consecutive years, and it is the country with the most complete industrial categories and industrial system, providing the world with a large number of quality and cost-efficient industrial raw materials and finished products. Meanwhile, China has the largest and fastest growing middle-income group, comprising a major new high-end market in the world.The U.S.-based Conference Board projects that emerging economies\' share of global gross domestic product (GDP) will have risen to 61 percent by 2035, based on purchasing power parities, with most of them counting China as their largest trading partner.Non-cooperation is the biggest risk, and excluding China from the international economic system will weaken the momentum of global economic growth and undermine global trade rules.The Singapore-based Straits Times commented that the negative impact of \"de-risking\" economic links with China goes far beyond China, the United States and the EU, but also affects other trading partners. \"De-risking\" is putting all parties involved at risk, it said.The United States also played up this narrative to conceal the fact that it is de facto the biggest risk and source of global chaos. A look at the history of recent world economic crises will suffice.In the 1997 Asian financial crisis, American hedge funds took advantage of the defects of the Asian economic and financial system to cash in on the Asian stock and foreign exchange markets, leaving many economies in bubbles, which eventually burst one after another.During the 2008 international financial crisis, U.S. financial entities sought to profit greatly from sub-prime loans. Credit rating agencies, which should have been the authoritative and just \"gatekeeper\" of the market, whitewashed \"toxic\" assets as \"quality\" ones to mislead global investors. Eventually, the crisis broke out and expanded, crippling the world economy.Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S.-led West frantically printed money to stimulate the economy, triggering steep inflation, and later on aggressively raised interest rates to curb inflation.Such an egoistic move once again took a heavy toll on many countries -- a sharp depreciation in their currencies, a surge in debt burdens, huge capital outflows, and weakened economies.And in the eyes of investors worldwide, China is still a land of all kinds of opportunities. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country welcomes China\'s development and prosperity, noting Germany rejects all forms of decoupling and \"de-risking\" is not \"de-sinicization.\"That is why key European businesses are expanding, not shrinking, their investments in the Chinese market. For example, German automaker Volkswagen signed late May a contract with the Hefei Economic Development Zone in east China\'s Anhui Province, announcing an investment of around 1 billion euros (1.1 billion dollars) to launch a new company in early 2024.At the end of the day, people will find the de-risking approach designed by a handful of Western politicians, if carried out, will bury development opportunities, undermine cooperation and stability, and lead to total destruction of the world economy at large. ', 'The De-risking decoupling system values energy drive Provinc', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 11:31, July 06, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The talk of de-risking from China has been gaining ubiquity among Wester', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 20:15:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040525.html');

(People\'s Daily/Wan Yu)Juncao, which literally means \"mushroom\" and \"grass\" in Chinese, can be used, as its name suggests, to grow edible mushrooms as livestock feed or as a green barrier to stop desertification. It is hailed by many as \"magic grass.\"As a female representative of the beneficiaries of the Juncao project of the China-UN Peace and Development Trust Fund, Korarome was the first Juncao grower to deliver a speech at the UN headquarters.She said in the speech that after receiving technical training and guidance from Chinese Juncao experts, she employed 25 people in her village to grow Juncao, most of whom were females. Every week, she would sell 200 kilograms of fresh mushrooms to local dealers. Soon she earned money, with which she built a new house and bought a new car for her family.The woman, in cooperation with Chinese experts, has offered training sessions for more than 1,500 people in 10 surrounding villages. The Juncao technology has increased local farmers\' income, and lowered the rate of malnutrition in the community from 70 percent to 55 percent, she noted.Her story has inspired people around. According to Korarome, people call her every day to congratulate her success and to learn the Juncao technology.The Juncao technology marks a successful practice of China in promoting poverty alleviation, as well as an important contribution made by the country to the sustainable development of the world.Juncao is a sound substitute for timber to be used as a substrate for growing edible mushrooms. It has solved the problem troubling the world that to produce edible mushrooms, trees must be cut down. So far, the technology has been applied in over 100 countries.I serve as the deputy director of the China National Engineering Research Center of Juncao Technology. Over the past more than 20 years, I have met many women like Korarome.After learning the Juncao technology, they became entrepreneurs and sci-tech workers. I see from them the strong aspiration of women in developing countries to eliminate poverty and embrace happiness, as well as the important role played by the Juncao technology in increasing the well-being of people, especially in improving the living environment for women.Fiji farmers joining a Juncao technical training program held by China show mushrooms they have grown. (Photo from the official website of the China International Development Cooperation Agency)I first realized that the Juncao technology could be life-changing for impoverished women when I worked in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa in 2005.In the province, there were many single mothers and grandmothers. They were poor in land and education, living on a meager income from government jobs.A Chinese idiom goes that giving a man a fish feeds him for a day, but teaching a man fishing feeds him for a lifetime. After learning the Juncao technology, these women saw their income increase. They could afford their children\'s schooling, opened groceries in villages and even started a logistics business, which completely changed the lives of themselves and their families.The UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development includes 17 sustainable development goals, and the Juncao technology serves 13 of them including gender equality. In many developing countries, the technology can not only lift women\'s social status, but also serve as a demonstration that helps improve local productivity and economic vitality.Under the guidance of Chinese experts, some women in Fiji, especially those with disabilities, have embraced a better life by growing Juncao. Among the nearly 2,000 people trained by the China-aided Juncao demonstration center in Fiji, women and people with disabilities account for 56.7 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.Arailde Fontes Urben, professor with the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, has contributed to the promotion of the Juncao technology in South America.Since she joined a training program on the Juncao technology in China in 1995, she has always been committed to the research and communication of the technology in South America. The expert, who is now in her 70s, has trained more than 2,000 people and translated a Chinese Juncao textbook into Portuguese, which was published in Brazil.Developing the Juncao technology would benefit the whole mankind. China\'s Juncao has blazed a trail of sustainable development for the world.It is believed that more and more women, who are indispensable for developing the industry, will realize their dreams with the Juncao technology.', 'Juncao', '2023-07-06', 'By Lin Dongmei (People\'s Daily) 13:39, July 06, 2023', 'At the recent 8th annual Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Susta', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 20:15:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040566.html');

That was how Babusha, an enormous sand dune on the southern edge of the Tengger Desert, got its name.\"Babu\" means eight steps in Chinese, and \"sha\" literally refers to sand.Having long been plagued by severe drought, the childhood memory of Guo Wangang, a native of Gulang County in the city of Wuwei, northwest China\'s Gansu Province, was filled with stifling sandstorms and endless yellow dunes.Fed up with the invasion of choking sand-dust storms, local residents, in the 1960s, took the plunge and waged a war against desertification, and henceforth a green belt, now dubbed the \"Green Great Wall,\" has gradually been established along the fringe of the desert.Now Babusha is better known as Babusha Forest Farm, and the once dry and barren land is now covered by vegetation.The summer in Babusha now is no longer what it was in Guo\'s memory. Rows of flowers are seen blooming at the eastern end of the Hexi Corridor, and the southern edge of Tengger Desert, and a light wind saturates the air with a burst of faint floral scent. Guo, who now serves as head of the farm, is leading the staff to water a Haloxylon ammodendron forest.Not far away, a white elm with a crown of more than 10 meters stands proudly as a witness to generations of painstaking effort in sand control.\"The elm was planted in 1978. The sandstorms used to be so powerful that even the roots on the windward side were sticking out,\" said Guo. \"Generations of saplings are like generations of sand fighters taking root in the desert and safeguarding their homes.\"In the past decade, the \"Great Green Wall\" along the 1,200-km line from the Maowusu Desert in the east to the Kumtag Desert in the west has safeguarded the oases in the vast expanses of sandy land.The Babusha Forest Farm has successively completed sand control and afforestation of over 280,000 mu (about 18,667 hectares) of land, and the transition zone from the oasis to the desert has expanded by 30 km as a whole.The oasis-desert transition zone is an ecological buffer zone between a mobile desert and an oasis, which is important in reducing the forward mobility of sand dunes and wind and sand hazards in an oasis.Like Babusha Forest Farm, green miracles have been seen in many other deserts in the country over the decades.During the 2012-2022 period, China\'s accumulative afforestation area reached 960 million mu, while 165 million mu of grassland was improved, and more than 12 million mu of wetlands were added or restored, official data showed.By 2025, China will have a total of 2 million hectares of desertified land sealed off for protection, with more than 6 million hectares of sandy land newly treated and 1.3 million hectares of rocky-desertification land harnessed, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.In Gansu, which is home to over 12 million hectares of sandy land, these efforts have brought a verdant look to the formerly barren land. Several dried-up lakes have been revived, and the variety of plants and birds has significantly increased.\"Currently, more than 1,200 km of windbreak and sand-fixing forest covering an area of over 4.6 million mu has been built in the northern part of the Hexi Corridor, protecting more than 1,400 villages from sandstorms,\" said Zhang Xuchen, head of the Gansu Forestry and Grassland Administration.', 'the oases safeguards Across Babusha hectares transition vege', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 16:12, July 06, 2023', 'LANZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Sand is just eight steps away.

This means we need to understand China more, not less.” The vice-chancellor adds that in engaging with China’s universities, we are tapping into the most informed, critical, internationalist and liberal institutions in Chinese society.“Two-way academic exchanges and collaborations are the best way for our society to keep abreast of a rapidly changing society and its evolving government imperatives.”“It is also mistaken to believe that ending collaboration with Australian universities will hamper China’s rise as a technology power.” Wesley says, “China has already risen.”He continues that “Its nine leading universities are much better funded than any of Australia’s, or the world’s outside the elite American universities. According to recent studies referenced in the journal Science, Chinese researchers account for the highest proportion of the most cited scientific papers of any country in the world. Other studies also show Chinese research is rising fast in innovation and quality.”Wesley says universities depend on access to the best talent and best ideas and, of course, these are not concentrated in any particular segment of the world’s population. “Closing off our knowledge sector from one-fifth of humanity, and a research system that is growing in resources and capability, would be a major mistake.”', 'australia', '2023-07-06', ' (People\'s Daily Online) 16:25, July 06, 2023', 'Micheal Wesley, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (international) of University of Melbourne calls for more', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 20:15:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040724.html');

At the same time, people-to-people and cultural exchanges need to be enhanced in the context of the BRI, showing that no one culture is superior to any other, he added.Siddharth Chatterjee, the UN Development System Resident Coordinator in China，noted that cross-cultural communication is essential to carrying out effective cooperation and safeguarding peace.In the past decade since the BRI was proposed, governments of the participating countries have engaged in frequent exchanges, and various forms of communication have also been carried out between their academic communities, civil societies, private sectors and non-governmental organizations.Photo shows the Forum on \"Heralding a New Chapter for Cultural Exchange Under the Belt and Road Initiative\" (part of the Maritime Silk Road International Documentary Film Festival) and Sub-Session on People-to-People Exchange of the 7th Taihe Civilizations Forum (TCF) in Quanzhou, southeast China\'s Fujian Province, on July 3.

The Japanese side deliberately restricted the IAEA task force for the review of the ocean discharge plan, to the exclusion of other potential options. Even though the IAEA recognized that the ocean discharge plan is in compliance with relevant international safety standards, it cannot prove that the ocean discharge plan is the only and optimal option for treating nuclear-contaminated water.\"Second, Japan did not justify the long-term effectiveness and reliability of the treatment facility,\" Deng said.He added that the data released by Japan shows that over 70 percent of the treated water does not meet standards and needs further treatment. The efficacy and reliability of the performance of the purification facility will decline further with the corrosion and aging of the facility in the course of future long-term operations.Third, Japan did not justify the authenticity and accuracy of the data of the nuclear-contaminated water, the official said.Deng added that the IAEA has only carried out a review and assessment of the data and information provided unilaterally by Japan, and conducted inter-laboratory comparisons for a small amount of samples of nuclear-contaminated water collected unilaterally by Japan. Under such circumstances the authenticity of data and the accuracy of information remains to be verified and independence and representativeness of sampling are seriously insufficient, the report is far from convincing.Fourth, Japan did not justify that the ocean discharge of nuclear-contaminated water is safe and harmless to the marine environment and human health.Deng said that the nuclear-contaminated water contains over 60 radionuclides. There is not yet effective technology to treat many of those radionuclides. Some long-lived radionuclides may spread with the ocean currents and cause uncertain impacts on the ecological balance of coastal waters of Japan\'s neighboring countries and may form a bio-concentration and pose potential hazards to food safety and human health.China urges Japan to face up to the legitimate concerns of the international community, and the opinions and advice from the IAEA and other authoritative international professional agencies, he said.China also calls on the IAEA to establish independent and effective long-term international monitoring arrangements led by the IAEA with the full participation of third-party laboratories from Japan\'s neighboring countries as soon as possible, attach importance to the views of experts from various countries, and take into full consideration the concerns and participation of stakeholders including Japan\'s neighboring countries and Pacific island countries, Deng said.', 'The IAEA nuclear-contaminated discharge justify countries da', '2023-07-06', ' (Xinhua) 16:56, July 06, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The report on the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushim', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 09:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0706/c90000-20040758.html');

This is in response to the escalating demand for deliveries, particularly for perishable products such as lychees, cherries, crayfish, ice creams, and ready-to-cook dishes.These companies have extended their cold-chain logistics service networks to rural areas and expanded the sales area of agricultural products.In Jiangjin district of Chongqing Municipality, southwest China, freshly harvested Sichuan peppers from a local planting base are sent directly to a nearby cold storage facility for packaging.

In a recent interview with People\'s Daily Online, the U.S. expert validated the vision and accomplishments of the Belt and Road Initiative, and advocated for enhanced China-U.S. relations through exchanges among their peoples.BRI allows countries to create their own futureTangen underscored the BRI\'s significant impact on global connectivity and economic growth. He lauded the initiative\'s effective role in promoting regional cooperation and boosting connectivity across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.He also criticized U.S. interference in the World Trade Organization (WTO). \"The U.S. has prevented the World Trade Organization from operating by refusing to allow judges to be appointed, and therefore there can be no final decision.\" He described it as the U.S. pulling back on free and fair trade. \"So as the U.S. pulled back, as the threat of containment increased, the Belt and Road Initiative was a welcome relief valve,\" he stated. \"It will allow countries to actually create their own future, not be reliant on other economies, but to build economies of their own, and to be able to use their economies to compete in the world and do a better job for their people.\"In discussing the BRI\'s future development on its 10th anniversary, Tangen stressed the importance of mutual trust. \"If I don\'t trust you as a person, we cannot have a relationship. If I can\'t trust you as a business, we cannot have a business relationship. And if I can\'t trust you as a country, we cannot have diplomacy between us,\" Tangen said. \"So, it\'s fitting that as this has been developed, it\'s become much more about people-to-people exchanges, understanding each other, and trusting each other,\" he said.\"De-risking\" equates to unilateral \"decoupling\"Tangen emphasized that U.S. geopolitical hegemony presents the primary challenge to the world. He rejected the notion that a single path in life exists for all countries and peoples, viewing this idea as the most significant hindrance. \"It\'s incorrect, but convincing the U.S. to acknowledge that will take time,\" he said.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently committed to \"de-risking\" instead of \"decoupling\" from China. Tangen noted that \"de-risking\" is merely a more subtle term for \"decoupling,\" and \"de-risking\" equates to unilateral \"decoupling.\"According to Tangen, \"De-risking\" was a compromise Blinken made with the Europeans because they disliked the word decoupling. \"\'De-risking\' means that I\'m going to separate from you, but I don\'t expect you to separate from me … Blinken only agreed to this change in words simply because the Europeans weren\'t quite comfortable with the idea of decoupling because they knew very well they couldn\'t decouple from China and still maintain robust exports. So, they said, can\'t we have another word? But the word does not have any kind of different meaning.\"People-to-people exchanges to strengthen China-US relationsIn light of the current complexities in China-U.S. relations, Tangen emphasized the crucial role of people-to-people exchanges in strengthening the relationship between the two nations. He recognized that cultural exchanges have been instrumental in promoting mutual understanding and building bridges between countries.\"Real change in Europe and America will not come from the top. That is clear; it must come from the bottom. And by that, I mean from the people\", Tangen stated. He suggested that the U.S. and China should have people-to-people communication, have more flights going back and forth, and host more student homestays for young people to understand the culture that they are in. \"There has to be a deepening of cultural exchange. It can\'t simply be a little visit\", he said.Tangen also highlighted the Global Civilization Initiative. \"What it is really talking about is respect for other cultures, for the fact that they have the right as sovereign nations to create their own path as they go forward, not be dictated to by any one country or group of countries.\"\"If you\'re going to respect something, you have to understand it,\" he said, adding that there is an increasing number of international educational programs bringing people to China and encouraging more Chinese students to study abroad so that mutual understanding between countries and their peoples can be further enhanced.', 'de-risking,decoupling', '2023-07-07', ' (People\'s Daily Online) 08:26, July 07, 2023', 'File photo of Einar Tangen (Photo courtesy of Taihe Institute)\nEinar Tangen, a U.S. current affairs', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 10:21:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20040818.html');

(Xinhua/Ren Chao)BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a significant increase in the size of its digital economy over the past seven years, amid the accelerating development of the global digital economy.According to a research report released Wednesday at the main forum of the ongoing Global Digital Economy Conference 2023 in Beijing, from 2016 to 2022, the scale of China\'s digital economy increased by 4.1 trillion U.S. dollars, with a compound annual growth rate of 14.2 percent.The scale of China\'s digital economy grew to 50.2 trillion yuan (about 6.96 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2022. The share of the digital economy in the country\'s GDP rose to 41.5 percent, making it an important engine for stable growth and transformation.Currently, countries around the world are accelerating the development of key areas of the digital economy, and actively seizing development opportunities in fields such as digital technologies and industries, industrial digitalization and data elements.For example, by March 2023, 256 network operators in 95 countries and regions had commercialized 5G technology, with 1.15 billion 5G users worldwide and a 30.6-percent population coverage rate of 5G network, an increase of 5.5 percent year on year.In 2022, the revenue of the global artificial intelligence market climbed to 450 billion U.S. dollars, up 17.3 percent year on year. The number of global digital economy unicorn enterprises reached 1,032, accounting for 74.14 percent of global unicorn enterprises, with an estimated value of 24.95 trillion yuan, according to the report.Mei Hong, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that China\'s digital transformation is advancing from the field of consumption and services to the manufacturing sector in the real economy.Data shows that in 2022, the operating income of China\'s electronic information manufacturing industry was 15.4 trillion yuan, while the software business made 10.8 trillion yuan and big data industry made 1.57 trillion yuan, laying a solid industrial and technological foundation for the integrated development of informatization and industrialization.Ahmed Abdel Hafez, chairman of the executive bureau of the Egyptian supreme cybersecurity council, said that China\'s achievements in the development of the digital economy have attracted worldwide attention. China\'s opening-up has created development opportunities for other countries, and given them the chance to share the development dividends of China\'s big market.Beijing and 18 partner cities, including Abu Dhabi, London, Macao, San Francisco, Vienna, Vientiane and Zaragoza, released the global digital economy partnership city cooperation initiative at the opening ceremony of the conference on Tuesday.The initiative covers aspects such as accelerating the digital transformation process of cities, green development through digital empowerment, and supporting global digital inclusive cooperation. It aims to build an open innovation network for the digital economy between global cities and within multi-bilateral frameworks.In 2021, Beijing put forward the development goal of accelerating the construction of a global benchmark city for the digital economy.

It is the 46th visit to China by the association\'s delegation since it was founded in 1954.Noting that this year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Wang Yi told his Japanese guest to build bilateral relations that meet the requirements of the new era based on fundamental principles, remain undisturbed by external distractions, implement the political consensus that China and Japan are cooperative partners rather than threats to each other, and jointly safeguard the hard-won peace and stability in Asia.He expressed the hope that Kono and the association will strengthen confidence in cooperation, oppose \"decoupling economies or severing supply chains\", and make new contributions to the improvement and development of China-Japan ties.During the meeting, Wang also slammed a claim in Japan that \"any contingency concerning Taiwan would be an emergency for Japan\", saying it is absurd and dangerous. He urged Tokyo to be highly vigilant against such claims.Kono said that Japan-China relations have come a long way and cooperation has brought benefits to both sides.The business community does not agree with the politicization of economic issues, and \"decoupling economies or severing supply chains\" is in the interests of no one, he said.Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, said that Kono\'s visit signaled the Japanese business community\'s willingness to improve bilateral ties through enhanced economic and trade cooperation with Beijing.Such a positive voice needs to be heard by Japanese politicians, he said, adding that Japan should look at the overall bilateral ties, and refrain from interfering in affairs concerning China\'s core interests or working with the United States to contain China.Despite the contradictions and challenges in China-Japan relations, it is important for the two countries to explore opportunities for cooperation and communication, he said.When addressing a welcoming banquet on Tuesday, Kono said that if Japan and China look at the current difficulties in their ties ten years from now, they will find that these difficulties can be overcome.He said he hopes to create a new future together with the Chinese side, and that cooperation is the best way to solve the difficulties in bilateral ties.', 'oppose called uphold decoupling cooperation bilateral China-', '2023-07-07', 'By ZHOU JIN (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:38, July 07, 2023', 'Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Thursday the China-Japan relationship is at a new critical j', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 09:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20040845.html');

[Photo/Xinhua]Currency faces pressure amid Fed rate hikes, slowing economic reboundChinese authorities are closely watching renminbi exchange rate movement and would take further action to defend the currency if it depreciates too rapidly amid the seemingly unfinished US rate hike cycle, experts said on Thursday.\"From a policy perspective, it is very important that the speed of depreciation of the renminbi does not accelerate too rapidly because that can then influence expectations of renminbi depreciation and then it can feed on itself,\" said Rob Subbaraman, head of global macro research at Nomura, a Japanese financial services group.Chinese authorities may therefore need to \"throw some sand in the wheels\" to ensure that renminbi depreciation does not become a one-way bet, Subbaraman said, adding that several tools could be used, including the foreign exchange deposit reserve requirement ratio.Amid a China-US monetary policy divergence and slowing momentum of China\'s economic recovery, the onshore renminbi has depreciated by more than 5 percent against the dollar since mid-April.After hitting an eight-month low of 7.2730 last Friday, the Chinese currency gained a firmer footing at 7.2465 per dollar as of 4:30 pm on Thursday.The renminbi, also known as the yuan, may continue to feel some pressure from the US dollar in the short term, experts said, as the People\'s Bank of China, the country\'s central bank, is set to maintain an accommodative monetary policy while the Fed will likely resume interest rate hikes. This divergence may widen US-China interest rate differentials and intensify capital outflow pressure on China.Minutes from the June meeting of the Fed\'s Federal Open Market Committee, released on Wednesday, said that \"almost all\" meeting participants believe additional interest rate hikes would be appropriate, though the Fed skipped a rate hike in June to \"assess additional information\".Following the release, traders bet that there are 88.7 percent odds that the Fed will raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.25-5.5 percent later this month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.David Chao, Invesco\'s global market strategist for the Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, said there are clear signs that Chinese policymakers are \"keeping a close eye\" on the renminbi exchange rate, considering the recent higher-than-expected central parity rates.The central parity rate of the renminbi — a fixed midpoint around which a 2 percent daily floating range is allowed — was set at 7.2098 per dollar on Thursday, stronger than Wednesday\'s closing price of 7.2444 at 4:30 pm.The PBOC vowed on Friday that it will \"firmly fend off the risk of drastic ups and downs in exchange rates\", followed by news reports on Sunday that major commercial banks had reduced the interest rates of dollar-denominated deposits, a move experts said will help alleviate renminbi depreciation pressure.Further defensive actions that may be taken soon include cutting foreign exchange deposit RRRs to boost foreign exchange liquidity and imposing a reserve requirement for foreign exchange derivative sales, said Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics.The short-term depreciation pressure, however, will not alter the basis for the renminbi to remain stable in the medium term, experts said, with ample policy room to solidify economic recovery as the key supporting factor.According to Chao at Invesco, China has significant \"dry powder\" — or available policy tools in reserve — to stimulate demand as domestic inflation remains low.Further stimulus measures may be announced shortly, which should be sufficient to revive market expectations and bring the economy back on a faster recovery track, he said.Pointing to the resilience of China\'s foreign exchange market, the country maintained a net foreign exchange settlement surplus by banks last month, with the reading improving from May, Financial News reported on Thursday.', 'Experts necessary defended Yuan renminbi exchange Fed deprec', '2023-07-07', 'By ZHOU LANXU (China Daily) 08:39, July 07, 2023', 'File photo shows a worker counts Chinese currency renminbi at a bank in Lianyungang, East China\'s J', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 09:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20040848.html');

He was awarded the China Reform Friendship Medal by the Chinese government in 2018 and met Xi.\"We are at the crossroads of history. Who knows where the world will be in 20 years\' time. But one thing is for sure. … The 48 Group will be doing the work in China to develop trade with China,\" Perry said.Writing on the current situation in his letter, Xi said today\'s world faces multiple, intertwined challenges, and \"economic globalization is facing countercurrents\".He called on individuals with great vision from all walks of life in China and the UK to \"carry on the Icebreaking Spirit — bearing far sight, seeking openness and cooperation, and daring to be pioneers\".In addition, Xi asked them to work hard to break new ground for win-win cooperation, promote the building of an open world economy, and make greater contributions to promoting China-UK friendship and cooperation.Observers and entrepreneurs said the Icebreaking Spirit is needed at a time when the overall China-UK and China-European Union ties and business exchanges of recent years have been overshadowed by rising voices in Europe calling for economic \"decoupling\" from China or \"de-risking\" of relations.Dominic Barton, chairman of multinational mining giant Rio Tinto, said \"there is a lot of rhetoric\" and \"a lot of noise\" advocating \"decoupling\" or \"de-risking\", and this is very negative for prosperity and for everyone.\"Trade is something we should remind ourselves that we shouldn\'t take for granted,\" he said.\"We have to speak up about the benefits of trade. It is really important for everyone, for everyone\'s standard of living. … That\'s another reason why I think we\'re reflecting today on the 70 years. It\'s kind of a rejuvenation,\" he added.Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said the lasting charm of the Icebreaking Spirit and the great roles played by the \"icebreakers\" over the past 70 years \"stem from efforts in catching up with the times, grasping historical opportunities and having the courage to join hands in taking the initiative\".Gordon Orr, vice-chair of the China-Britain Business Council, said, \"Trade and investment forms the foundation of this relationship.\" He noted that at the China International Fair for Trade in Services this year, the UK will be the country of honor.\"This year, renewed connections, strong focus on economic growth, and China\'s continued opening up to international business make this again an important icebreaking moment,\" he added.Liu Jin, president of Bank of China, said that China is a driving force for advancing global free trade and stabilizing world economic growth, adding that deepening collaboration between Chinese and UK businesses is highly practical.', 'Xi icebreakers legacy hails key of China-UK cooperation Iceb', '2023-07-07', 'By ZHANG YUNBI (Chinadaily.com.cn) 08:47, July 07, 2023', 'Trade: Xi says \'bright future\' was foreseen by delegation\nIn 1953, a group of British entrepreneurs,', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 09:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20040870.html');

The increase in China\'s economic and political influence at the international level is essential for maintaining global peace and development in accordance with the China-proposed Global Civilization Initiative, which is aimed at building a new, fair and just multipolar world order as an alternative to the existing unipolar and unfair international order.The Global Civilization Initiative draws on China\'s long history and the prime position it once held as a civilization.Proposing the Global Civilization Initiative earlier this year, President Xi Jinping said it will inject fresh and strong energy into common development and progress in a world fraught with multiple challenges and crises. Elaborating on the initiative at the Communist Party of China in Dialogue with World Political Parties High-Level Meeting in March, Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, called for respecting the diversity of civilizations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and strengthening people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.We Palestinians welcome the Global Civilization Initiative, as it is based on mutual respect, mutual benefit, equality and development of all countries. Fair and just resolution of global and regional issues has been hindered under the United States-led world order. The Global Civilization Initiative, on the other hand, is a visionary initiative that aligns with Palestinian aspirations and could help the Palestinian president to convene an international peace conference.The initiative creates an ideal opportunity in the year that marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Palestine and China to work toward achieving tangible results, in order to realize better benefits for the peoples of both countries and expand cooperation in various fields. Sino-Palestinian constructive cooperation has been progressing well, giving us enough reasons to be optimistic about the possibility of further deepening pragmatic cooperation.Besides, the Belt and Road Initiative is not merely a modern version of the ancient Silk Road; it is also a vehicle to boost China\'s soft power and crystallize the contours of China\'s growing role in the international system which is undergoing structural changes. It is based on trade and economy, common interests, and market openness, not on any ideology, as is the case with the US-led world order. In fact, for the US and some other Western countries, even their foreign policies are shaped based on their ideology.Sino-Palestinian diplomatic relations are based on the acknowledgement of the \"one China\" principle, which is also the fundamental political basis for the development of bilateral relations between China and other countries. China treats all countries as equals, emphasizes the importance of consultation and dialogue to resolve bilateral and regional issues, and promotes common development without attaching any political conditions.Given these facts, we Palestinians support and are ready to participate in the Global Civilization Initiative, the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative.During Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\'s four-day visit to China starting on June 14, the two sides jointly announced the establishment of a strategic partnership. President Xi said China and Palestine are good friends and partners that trust and support each other.Given the fast-changing international situation and new changes in the situation in the Middle East, China has said it is willing to strengthen coordination and cooperation with Palestine to promote a comprehensive, fair and lasting solution to the Palestine issue. In fact, China has always supported the just cause of the Palestinian people to restore their legitimate national rights.The two sides should therefore deepen cooperation and promote genuine pluralism to better protect the common interests of developing countries and help build a fair and just world order. It is necessary to mention here that China is taking measures to expand coordination and cooperation with Palestine to push for an early, just and sustainable resolution to the Palestinian issue.Further, the strategic partnership between the two sides is an important milestone in bilateral relations, which will pave the way for China to consolidate friendly cooperation with Palestine in various fields.We expect China to continue supporting the just Palestinian cause, and hope that China will spare no efforts in helping seek serious negotiations in an attempt to resolve the Palestinian issue. And as Palestinians, we must seize this historic moment to strengthen relations with China as a strategic partner and true friend. Palestine also needs to increase practical engagement in the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative while playing an important role in shaping humanity\'s shared destiny.China has begun its journey to build a modern socialist country, which would achieve the goals of developing Arab-Chinese projects and launching strategic partnerships between China and Arab countries, representing a successful model of solidarity, cooperation and mutual benefit.We Palestinians should strive to achieve shared development, promote justice and fairness, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and integrate the Belt and Road Initiative with the development projects of Arab states, implement the consensuses reached at the Arab-China Summit for Cooperation and Development in Riyadh in December last year, promote the values of solidarity, tolerance and mutual respect, and vigorously move toward the goal of building an Arab-Chinese community with a shared future.The author is the secretary-general of the Popular Struggle Front of Palestine and a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization.', 'Palestine inject Chinas initiatives welcomes Initiative coop', '2023-07-07', 'By Ahmad Majdalani (China Daily) 08:56, July 07, 2023', 'Tourists pack the ancient city of Datong in Shanxi province on Jan 29.

The disease prevention and control bureau under the National Health Commission issued a guideline on preventing the health hazards of heatwaves, advising people to drink enough water and limit time spent outdoors.The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security also urged employers to strengthen health checks for employees, adjust their working hours, and improve working conditions.In Beijing, urban management and traffic authorities have increased the frequency of spraying water on the roads to reduce ground surface temperatures. The authorities also used more mechanical equipment to reduce manual work during the hottest time of the day.In Xuanwu District of Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu, the local government has launched a service station powered by rooftop photovoltaic panels in a scenic spot.

TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYEditor\'s note: As protection of the planet\'s flora, fauna and resources becomes increasingly important, China Daily is publishing a series of stories to illustrate the country\'s commitment to safeguarding the natural world.The status of one of China\'s best-loved primates has recently been lowered from \'vulnerable\' to \'near threatened\'. Yan Dongjie reports from Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan.The Tang family has lived in Taiping, a village in the Baihe River National Nature Reserve, Jiuzhaigou county, Sichuan province, for many generations. The villagers have lived alongside golden snub-nosed monkeys for centuries, enjoying a harmonious relationship with the animals and passing down many legends.\"It is said that in ancient times, when a hunter aimed his gun at a monkey, she reflexively grabbed her infant and turned her back to the hunter, as if to say, \'Don\'t shoot my child.\' This legend has been passed down, so local people have never hunted golden snub-nosed monkeys and the animals have settled in this area,\" Tang Yulin said. \"Every villager loves the monkeys. It\'s a tradition.\"Tang Yulin plays with some monkeys. CHINA DAILYTang observed the golden snub-nosed monkeys with his father and great-uncle, who worked in the reserve when he was a child. He believes that, much like humans, the monkeys experience various emotions, to which he is deeply attuned.He thinks that their calls indicate at least seven emotions: \"Pupu\" signals laughter; \"Jiajia\" indicates alarm; \"Aiai\" is a greeting; \"Guga\" shows fear; \"Wawa\" is flirtatious; \"Wuwu\" suggests happiness; and \"Wowo\" is the monkey version of shouting.\"Your photos haven\'t captured the monkeys\' beauty. Look how stunning they are,\" Tang told me, when I visited.During our conversation, his every word and every gesture reflected his love of the monkeys, as well as his desire for more people to understand and protect them.Golden monkey Yuli, who was named by Tang Yulin, sits on a branch. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYLong-term commitmentWhen the Baihe River National Nature Reserve was established in the 1960s, Tang\'s great-uncle was one of the first staff members to move there. He spent more than 20 years in the reserve, patrolling the mountains every day, keeping an eye on the monkeys\' health, preventing fires and protecting the environment.Influenced by his family, Tang\'s father also became a golden monkey expert and worked at the reserve for more than 20 years. Tang is the third generation of his family to work as a forest ranger in the reserve.He knows every type of plant and tree in the reserve, which has earned him the nickname \"the living map\".He said the reserve covers more than 16,000 hectares, while the most recent \"census\" showed that there were roughly 1,700 golden snub-nosed monkeys living there. They are divided into six communities, each of which is similar to a human village and consists of several families.Located in Jiuzhaigou county, the reserve overlaps significantly with the Giant Panda National Park, which was established in 2017 as a pilot program.\"There are many nationally protected wild animals in the reserve, such as black bears, antelopes, Tibetan gazelles and giant pandas,\" Tang said.\"There are also several species of birds under level one State protection, such as Chinese monals and golden eagles.\"The golden snub-nosed monkey gets its name from its upturned nose, and is divided into five species: the Sichuan golden monkey; the Yunnan golden monkey; the Guizhou golden monkey; the Nujiang golden monkey; and the Vietnamese golden monkey.The first three species on the list are unique to China.Golen monkey Tianye climbs a tree. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYOn May 22, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly released the Red List of China\'s Biodiversity: Vertebrate (2020), which downgraded the Sichuan golden monkey\'s status from \"vulnerable\" to \"near threatened\".The list shows that through the collective efforts of various protection zones in China, the number of Sichuan golden monkeys in the wild has risen from 14,000 in 2002 to about 25,000, while the population\'s distribution has expanded significantly, which illustrates the success of the conservation efforts.Tang said that the Baihe reserve has a humid climate and lush vegetation, which serves as a rich source of food for the monkeys, who mainly eat wild plants, fruit and vegetables. They consume tender tree leaves in spring, wild fruit in autumn and tree bark to survive the harsh winter.\"So, protecting the environment here is the best way to protect the Sichuan golden monkey. Fire prevention is a major focus,\" Tang said, noting that no fires have been reported at the Baihe reserve for more than 40 years.Two golden snub-nosed monkeys sit on a tree in Jiuzhaigou. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYTightknit speciesTang said that the Sichuan golden monkey is a very tightknit species, and whenever they are attacked by enemies, they fight together.\"On several occasions, I have seen that when a golden eagle tried to catch a monkey, all the monkeys made screeching noises and kept jumping at it one after another to drive it away. Also, when a monkey is injured, others in the group will take care of it,\" he said.He recalled that when experts from China and the United States came to the reserve in 1996 to watch and study the monkeys, he helped them observe and record the animals\' behavior, gaining a slew of professional knowledge in the process.\"Our camp was located at an altitude of 2,500 meters, and the monkeys lived very close to us, about 300 to 400 meters away. We used binoculars to observe them. I saw that five monkeys were huddled together in the trees every day and did not move. Later, I discovered that the monkey in the middle was sick, and the others were protecting and taking care of him,\" he said.Tang said the realization that Sichuan golden monkeys are just like humans — showing emotions and protecting their companions — has deepened his fascination with the species.Today, the number of Sichuan golden monkeys in the reserve has doubled, compared with the 1980s. Tang said that in addition to protecting the animals, he is thinking about how he can use the reserve\'s unique natural resources to bring financial benefits to the local people.However, Mo Cheng, director of the Baihe River National Nature Reserve, struck a note of caution.\"We are very conflicted. The tourism resources here are very good, and we want to open up and bring benefits to the local people, but we are also reluctant to develop because we don\'t want to damage the plants and animals,\" he said.\"With the advance of science and technology, we can gradually achieve some reasonable development while ensuring the protection of the environment.

(Xinhua/Li Xueren)Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the 23rd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and delivered an important speech via video conference in Beijing on July 4.It was an important multilateral diplomatic action taken by China to better engage with Eurasia. Xi\'s remarks at the meeting injected important impetus into building SCO consensus for development and building an SCO community with a shared future.This year marks the 10th anniversary of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind put forward by Xi. Over the past decade, facing the changes of the world, of the times and of history, the SCO has always been at the forefront of the times, upholding this very vision and the Shanghai Spirit to build an SCO community with a shared future.Xi summarized the experiences and achievements of SCO, charting the course for it to keep building an SCO community with a shared future.The organization has followed its fine tradition of standing together through thick and thin, as passengers in the same boat should do, acted out the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, embraced the development philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared growth, carried forward the spirit of good-neighborliness, and advocated equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness between civilizations, upheld international fairness and justice, and opposed hegemonic, high-handed, and bullying acts, Xi said in the speech.SCO countries reiterated that to jointly build a new type of international relations based on mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation and a community with a shared future for mankind is of important practical significance. It once again proved the strong influence and vitality of the vision.Xi places high importance on the SCO. He always stresses the importance of upholding and carrying forward the Shanghai Spirit, and pursuing the organization\'s development as it pursues common development for humanity.The Chinese President has attended multiple summits of the organization since 2013, drawing a blueprint for its development and guiding it toward long-term and stable development.At previous SCO summits, he called on relevant parties to strengthen cooperation and get together for self improvement, and see each other in a common endeavor and a community with a shared future and interests. He also encouraged SCO countries to follow the Shanghai Spirit to build a community with a shared future for the region.He always stresses the importance of solidarity and collaboration and has raised a series of initiatives for deepening SCO cooperation, winning active response and support from relevant parties.The world today is undergoing both transformation and upheaval; changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace; human society faces unprecedented challenges. Unity or split, peace or conflict, cooperation or confrontation -- these are the questions raised again by the times.Responding to the questions, Xi said that \"The people\'s wish for a happy life is our goal, and peace, development and win-win cooperation are the unstoppable trends of the times.\"To respond to the call of the times, the SCO must keep in mind its founding mission, and stay in unity and coordination to bring more certainty and positive energy to world peace and development.Xi said that the SCO should keep to the right direction and enhance solidarity and mutual trust, maintain regional peace and safeguard common security, focus on practical cooperation and expedite economic recovery, strengthen exchanges and mutual learning and forge closer bonds between the peoples, and practice multilateralism and improve global governance.These important suggestions and new cooperation initiatives proposed by Xi demonstrated China\'s sense of responsibility as a major country in deepening SCO cooperation in various fields.As a comprehensive regional cooperation organization that covers the widest area and largest population in the world, the SCO is committed to upholding mutual respect and the principle of equality among all countries regardless of their size. It firmly safeguards and practices true multilateralism, and has blazed a new trail of international relations that features partnership over alliance and cooperation over confrontation, becoming a pillar force in advocating international fairness and justice.This time, the SCO officially welcomed Iran as a full member and signed the memorandum of obligations on the membership of Belarus. This manifested the vitality of the SCO family, and demonstrated relevant parties\' recognition to the SCO\'s important contributions to deepening good-neighborliness, protecting the common interests of SCO countries, promoting long-term peace and stability of the region and the world, and advancing sustainable development.A just cause finds great support, and a journey with many companions gets far. As long as all relevant parties keep moving in the right direction of promoting solidarity, mutual trust, development and cooperation, the SCO will definitely grow from strength to strength.

While some US officials have downplayed their expectations for any major breakthroughs from Yellen\'s visit, Chinese experts believe that one major point of significance of Yellen\'s trip is to keep high-level communication channels open, which may help bilateral relations walk out of their downward spiral, while more time is needed for the two countries to rebuild mutual trust.The US treasury chief arrived in Beijing on a mission to find common ground for the two countries to work together, as Yellen earlier revealed that she would meet with senior Chinese officials, discuss the importance of responsibly managing US-China relations, address areas of concern and tackle global challenges. Neither side has provided a detailed itinerary of her visit, which, according to the Wall Street Journal, concludes on Sunday.Some US media outlets saw the visit as part of efforts to sooth strained relations, which also marks a \"deepening thaw\" in US-China relations following the recent visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing.Yellen, who is seen as a voice of moderation in the Biden administration, has been adopting a less hawkish and more pragmatic view on maintaining economic ties with China, opposing additional tariffs and warning that \"de-coupling\" with the world\'s second-largest economy would be \"disastrous.\"Issues on the agendaThe talks will involve the negotiations of macroeconomic and fiscal policies and the implementation of macroeconomic and fiscal policies in specific areas, such as the US debt problem, and when it comes to trade and investment issues, US tariffs on Chinese goods is also a topic of concern, as they have become a burden for American consumers, Lü Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.\"If the US takes the initiative to cancel or reduce some of the tariffs, those moves could be taken as a positive sign in easing the tensions between the two countries. A small step forward in China-US relations could be very meaningful for the global economy,\" Lü said.Some US media outlets said the US Treasury chief faces a diplomatic test in her high-stakes visit to China. The New York Times said she will need to \"defend export controls and tariffs while explaining that the US does not aim to harm China\'s economy.\"The key issues of discussion for both sides during Yellen\'s visit would be the cancellation of the US\' additional tariffs on China, the withdrawal of its \"301 investigation\" into China, and the review of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement, Zhu Min, former deputy governor of the People\'s Bank of China and former deputy managing director of the IMF, told the Global Times in a recent interview.While trade remains the cornerstone of China-US economic relations, the cancellation of additional tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US is the first issue that needs to be discussed between the two sides, Zhu said.Some experts also believed that Yellen may address the fiscal and financial issues between the two countries, for example, trying to persuade China to refrain from reducing its holdings of US Treasury bondsand instead increase them at the appropriate time to help the US address its own inflation issues.\'New normal\'Yellen\'s visit came shortly after China announced export controls on Monday on gallium and germanium, which are critical for the manufacturing of chips and other high-tech components.China\'s latest export controls are not aimed at Yellen but serve as a warning shot to the US, as it has been roping in its allies to escalate the chip war and high-tech crackdown against China, disregarding the potential damage the technological \"iron curtain\" may cause to global supply and industrial chains, some experts said.A US Commerce Department spokesperson said on Wednesday that the US \"firmly\" opposes export controls announced by China on gallium and germanium, adding that Washington will consult its partners and allies to address the issue, Reuters reported.The gallium and germanium export controls do not target any specific country, and China informed the US and EU about the measure prior to the announcement, Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Shu Jueting said on Thursday. She said that \"the export controls are not an export ban,\" and signify that \"permits will be issued\" in accordance with relevant regulations.\"The export control shows that if the US dares to infringe the interests of China, China will strike back so as to give the US a hard lesson,\" Dong Shaopeng, a senior research fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Thursday.China has played this \"card\" of imposing export controls on key minerals, and we need serious consideration not only on rare-earth supplies, but also on US debt allocation, and the exchange rate between China and the US amid a changing US-China rivalry, Dong noted.\"Despite shifting from \'de-coupling\' to \'de-risking,\' the essence of [US] containing China has not changed. Although Yellen and her team claimed to be rejecting economic \'decoupling,\' it does not mean the US has changed its strategy to contain China,\" Dong said.As high-level exchanges between the two countries in some areas such as diplomacy and economic and trade have resumed, both US and Chinese experts raised questions over whether it\'s possible to shape a new framework for bilateral relations or whether bilateral ties have entered a new normal.\"I think the two sides have not entered a stable and completely predictable situation. Although China\'s policy has been consistent and persistent, the US could come up with more unpredictable measures, considering the factors of its domestic politics, including the [upcoming] election season,\" Lü said.\"It will take time to rebuild mutual trust,\" he noted.', 'export controls Treasury address tariffs noted media outlets', '2023-07-07', 'By Chen Qingqing (Global Times) 09:25, July 07, 2023', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrived in Beijing on Thursday afternoon, kicking off a four-day', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 09:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20040967.html');

Despite several rounds of talks, no significant breakthrough has been achieved since the end of the last round in August 2022.Also speaking at the Security Council briefing, Geng Shuang, China\'s deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, pointed out that the previous U.S. administration unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA and exerted extreme pressure on Iran, which triggered the Iranian nuclear crisis.It is regrettable that the negotiations have stalled since August 2022, Geng said, calling on the United States and other relevant parties to seize the positive momentum, adopt a pragmatic approach and move in the same direction as Iran and promote the early return of the JCPOA to the right track.He also urged the United States to lift all unilateral sanctions and \"long-arm jurisdiction\" measures against Iran and any third party, stop the wrongful threat of use of force and to create favorable conditions for an early and full resumption of implementation of the JCPOA.All parties should maintain a rational attitude, treat the Iranian nuclear issue separately from other issues and avoid any negative move that could escalate the situation and undermine a political and diplomatic solution, Geng said.China has always been committed to maintaining effectiveness of the JCPOA and the authority of the Security Council resolutions, and has always participated in the political and diplomatic solution of the Iranian nuclear issue in a constructive manner, he said.China is ready to keep close contact with all parties to push the JCPOA back on the right track at an early date, maintain the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as peace and stability in the Middle East, said Geng.', 'the JCPOA UN Iranian nuclear Geng address sanctions parties ', '2023-07-07', ' (Xinhua) 10:14, July 07, 2023', 'UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Diplomacy is the only way to effectively address the Iranian nucl', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 10:21:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041016.html');

Photo: Chen Xia/GTThe development of China\'s artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining momentum despite increasingly fierce global competition and the US\' relentless push for \"tech decoupling,\" with domestic tech firms showcasing various breakthroughs in key technologies at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) which kicked off in Shanghai on Thursday.Business insiders and experts said China has a long way to go to achieve high-tech self-reliance but they expressed firm confidence in the country\'s capability of attaining the goal on the back of policy support, industrial and supply chain coordination and continuous opening-up.On Thursday, a multitude of people gathered to interact with the large language models which are the most popular attraction in this year\'s event. NetEase Youdao unveiled an interactive English language learning chatbot at the event, which allows speakers to practice spoken English with the AI model.Chinese tech firm Meituan launched the 4.0 version of its unmanned aircraft system at the event. Compared with the previous editions, it has longer delivery range and better performance operating in inclement weather environment.In terms of semiconductors, a number of domestic chip companies including Enflame, Vastai Technologies and Hexaflake unveiled their cutting-edge AI chips, which enable large language models to process vast amounts of data at lightning speed.\"Recently, we have surpassed US chip giant Nvidia\'s high-end chips in a single benchmark for image recognition on the international stage. This achievement is a result of a step-by-step process,\" a sales representative surnamed Wang from a startup AI company told the Global Times on Thursday.Compared with Nvidia, we follow a different technological path to enhance performance by optimizing algorithms and reducing computational load, Wang said.The process of achieving self-reliance in science and technology has helped Chinese high-tech enterprises to forge their core competitiveness, and enabled them to become an essential part in the global innovative industrial chain.According to 2022 Global AI Innovation Index Report released at the WAIC, China ranks second in Global AI Innovation Index for the third straight year in 2022, as it has been accelerating efforts in expanding its talent pool, building data infrastructure and making technological breakthroughs.Despite some Western media hyping about the conference having lost the shine among the US giants, this year\'s WAIC however saw the participation of a record number of companies, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Focused on high-tech sectors including large models, chips, robots, and intelligent driving, the global event attracted more than 400 exhibitors and over 50 outstanding startups, with more than 30 cutting-edge products debuted for the first time. The organizer also said that the exhibition area totaled more than 50,000 meters. The number for participating companies and the venue area are at their highest levels since 2018, when the annual event was inaugurated, according to Xinhua.While adhering to self-reliant innovation, China has been actively promoting scientific and technological sharing and exchanges, aiming to contribute to global sci-tech development for the benefit of all mankind.In a sign of sound exchanges between Chinese and US business communities despite the Biden administration\'s mounting \"decoupling\" pressure, a number of high-profile US multinationals including Google and Tesla also showcased their AI-powered products and services at the WAIC.In a video speech delivered to the opening ceremony of the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk lauded China\'s advance in the field. \"I think, really, China is going to be great at anything it puts its mind into. That includes many different sectors - sectors of the economy, but also artificial intelligence,\" he said.Xiang Ligang, director general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times, \"It has become a consensus among the domestic tech industry that they will strive for achieving self-reliance in high technologies whatever measures the US take.\"While US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\'s visit to China following a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing sends a positive sign of stabilizing China-US relations, there is no sign of any relaxation in the US\' containment of China.On June 27, US media reported that the US Commerce Department will stop the shipments of AI chips made by Nvidia and other chip companies to customers in China as early as July. Amid the US pressure to cut China off from key chipmaking tools, the Netherlands last Friday announced new export controls on advanced semiconductor equipment.\"The US has abused export control measures, continues to mount crackdown on China\'s semiconductor sector and purposely decouple the global chip market. The US\' actions harm global free trade, while ignoring international trade rules and trample on fair competition principle,\" Shu Jueting, spokesperson for China\'s Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular press briefing on Thursday.The semiconductor industry is a typical example of global division and China is the world\'s largest semiconductor market whose chip sales account for around one-third of the global total, Shu said, noting that this is a result of win-win cooperation between Chinese enterprises and those from other countries.\"The US\' moves harm not only the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies but also the interests of many other countries and regions, and hinder global sci-tech exchanges and economic and trade cooperation,\" Shu said, noting that they will backfire.\"Over the past five years, I strongly felt growing demand for domestic replacements, strengthened coordination between upstream and downstream companies as well as growing importance the authorities and investors attached to the high-tech sector. I believe Chinese chips will be able to compete with those made in the US one day,\" Wang said.\"The US\' actions will eventually come back to haunt itself, as its relentless containment of China - one of the world\'s most vibrant markets and one of the major sources of US firms\' revenues - will hurt its own intellectual property prowess and its global competitiveness in cutting edge technologies,\" Xiang said.The US\' two-faced foreign policy of seeking macro-economic policy coordination with China to solve the US\' own financial and economic problems while retraining from win-win cooperation with China will not yield any result the US side wants, he said, noting that it\'s the best choice for the US to conduct trade and tech cooperation with China.', 'The startup chips semiconductor US enabled number technologi', '2023-07-07', ' (Global Times) 10:21, July 07, 2023', 'Vsitors experience artificial intelligence that detects and interprets human emotional signals at 2', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 10:40:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041026.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Biggest risk stems from non-cooperation, biggest hidden security threat remains non-development - People\'s Daily Online', 'The term \"de-risking\" has been replacing \"decoupling\" these days, becoming a new argument of some Western politicians when they talk about economic relations with China. It is used to prettify their negative policies aiming at de-sinicization.The so-called \"de-risking\" is in essence the politicization and ideologicalization of economic and trade issues. It is against laws of economics, disturbs the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains, and finally impedes the recovery of the world economy.\"De-risking may feel more diplomatic than decoupling.\" The New York Times just told the truth.The high-profile \"decoupling\" strategy launched by the last U.S. administration has been approved to be totally unrealistic. Though the current U.S. administration claimed it has no intention to contain China, its scheme to undermine China-U.S. economic relations through political means remains unchanged. Therefore, some in the United States created new rhetoric as the \"decoupling\" strategy has lost its support.The qualifier of \"not seeking \'decoupling\'\" is added to \"de-risking\" because the latter shall sound different and thus be more misleading. However, the so-called \"de-risking\" is just \"old wine in a new bottle.\"First of all, policies under \"de-risking\" still aim at technological blockade, investment review and transfer of supply chains. A high-ranking official of the U.S. government recently said in a speech that the United States wants to de-risk and diversify its relationship with China, not decouple. However, the official, at the same time, made reference to the approach of \"small yard, high fence\" to critical technology.What\'s more, the true intention of \"de-risking\" is still containing China and serving White House\'s wrong policies on China. U.S. magazine Foreign Affairs noted that the strategy of de-risking aims to limit China\'s abilities in strategic sectors that have national security implications, and reduce Beijing\'s leverage over the West by eroding Chinese dominance of the market for certain essential inputs.In today\'s world, countries should be dependent on each other, and such interdependence doesn\'t mean insecurity. \"De-risking\" is indeed \"diplomatic,\" but it cannot lift the United States out of the predicament in the country\'s economic relations with China. On one hand, the White House is aware that \"de-coupling\" hurts its own interests and remains unrealistic; on the other hand, it is not willing to abandon its obsession of taking China as an \"imaginary enemy\" and is seeking \"de-coupling\" in another form. Such a self-contradictory mindset would only confine the United States in a cage that it has built.Free trade and division of labor are the result of growing social productivity, and the formation and development of the global industrial and supply chains an outcome of economic globalization and market economy. To strengthen division of labor and collaboration among countries amid economic globalization leads to common progress.China makes opportunities, not risks. China is the world\'s second largest economy, biggest manufacturer, and largest trading country in goods. As a major trading partner for more than 140 countries and regions, it is continuously powering global growth.The World Openness Report 2022 showed that China has made progress in its high-level opening up and constantly improved its openness index, becoming a key variable for economic globalization.Gideon Rachman, chief foreign affairs commentator of the Financial Times, belies that de-risking trade with China is a risky business.Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund warned that \"de-risking\" is political manipulation that hurts the stability of global industrial and supply chains, and impedes global sci-tech progress and economic development. What the international society should be watchful about and resist is the promotion of de-sinicization in the name of \"de-risking,\" he said, adding that the trend of \"de-risking\" could see countries turn inward at the expense of global growth.\"There is a danger that the global economy could fragment into blocks,\" the economist noted.One of the goals of the United States in hyping the strategy of \"de-risking\" is to mislead its allies and then form a clique that contains China in the realm of economy. However, U.S. allies are clear and vigilant about the fact that such political calculation would hurt their own interests.According to a poll launched by the European Council on Foreign Relations in 11 EU countries, 43 percent of respondents see China as \"a necessary partner,\" and there are more respondents believing cooperation with China would bring opportunities than those who think it creates risks.Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stressed that European countries should view China more objectively, and both \"decoupling\" and \"de-risking\" would be a suicide committed by the European economy.The biggest risk stems from non-cooperation and the biggest hidden security threat is non-development.As the world is facing increasing instability and uncertainty, every country has its own security concerns. However, abusing the concept of national security and taking it as an excuse for promoting protectionism and containing other countries would only make risks riskier and lead to more and bigger problems.The historical trend of economic globalization has never changed. Today, the rapid advance of new technologies such as digital technology and artificial intelligence, is creating more favorable conditions for economic globalization. The world should not, and cannot return to a state of seclusion or isolation.Cooperation is the only way out and the best way to deal with difficulties and challenges. Countries should follow the trend of history, cement the consensus on development, and continue their efforts to build an open world economy. They should oppose the politicization of economic issues and work together to keep global industrial and supply chains stable and smooth, and deliver the fruits of globalization to different countries and groups of people in a more equitable way.', 'de-risking,decoupling', '2023-07-07', 'By Huan Yuping (People\'s Daily) 11:12, July 07, 2023', 'The term ', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:12:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041079.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Exploring natural solutions for farmland sustainability - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Xiaoxuan, a former deputy to the National People\'s Congress, China\'s top legislature, was glad to see his suggestion on protecting earthworms and ensuring farmland and food security included in this year\'s \"No. 1 central document.\"Outlining the key tasks for developing agriculture and comprehensively promoting rural revitalization, the document urges a severe crackdown on soil destruction behaviors, including earthworm hunting through electric machinery.The move came after China has managed to ensure its farmland area stay above the red line of 1.8 billion mu (about 120 million hectares), reflecting a greater policymaking emphasis now more than ever on farmland quality, Li noted.Kong Xiangbin, a professor at the China Agricultural University, echoed that Chinese farmers and agro-technicians are keen on seeking natural methods for preserving soil ecosystems and improving farmland fertility to promote sustainable agriculture, as there is a growing awareness of earthworm protection, corn straw reuse, and the development of circular farming.PROTECTING SOIL ECOSYSTEMTiny as it is, the earthworm works as the \"engineer\" of the soil ecosystem. As the largest fauna in this ecosystem, it is also a vital biological indicator in China\'s soil census, according to Kong.However, many have been hunted in recent years for use in medicine, feed, bait, and liquid fertilizer, and the cost of breeding is high.\"Orders of electric machinery for earthworm hunting received by some e-commerce companies can be as many as 1 million,\" said Li. \"With these machines, people can kill 7.5 billion earthworms in one year, making about 250,000 hectares of land unable to degrade pollutants.\"\"Earthworms play a vital role in improving soil fertility, promoting the degradation of organic matter, the cycle of nutrients, and optimizing the conditions of the microbial community,\" said Kong. \"The balance of the farmland ecosystem will be damaged if earthworms are hunted.\"\"If the farmland ecosystem is destructed, grain production will reduce,\" Li said, noting that prohibiting earthworm hunting helps remove hidden dangers that threaten food security.China\'s crackdown on earthworm hunting shows that the country not only focuses on securing the quantity of farmland but also aims at ensuring the ecological quality of the land, said Yang Zhaoxia, a professor at the Beijing Forestry University.USING NATURAL FERTILIZERIn the hot summer months, corn thrives in the thick black soil of the Xinjuqiang Machinery Planting Cooperative. Zhao Xinkai, director of the cooperative, has full confidence in this year\'s harvest.Located in Jilin Province, one of China\'s northeastern provincial-level regions with rare black soil resources and producing a quarter of China\'s grain, the cooperative has set a typical example in preventing soil erosion and degradation through crop straw mulching to promote conservation tillage.\"Before we cover the farmland with corn straw, farmers could clearly see soil deteriorate due to wind and water erosion. And the quality of the crops grown in such soil also downgraded,\" Zhao recalled.Each year when harvesting the corn in autumn, Zhao and his colleagues use machines to scatter the straw on the land between the plants. When the next spring comes, there is no need for plowing and ridging before sowing new corn.Compared with the traditional way of planting, about 100 kg of chemical fertilizer could be saved per hectare this way. But the output of corn, rather than shrinking, even increased.\"The fertility of the land was improved two to three years after we adopted the measure of crop straw mulching,\" Zhao was excited to see the change, \"the black soil is back!\"In the Black Soil Protection Law, which took effect in August 2022, China proposed the principle of coordinating land use and conservation and urged improving the quality of the black soil with conservation tillage measures, such as zero-tillage, reduced tillage, subsoiling, as well as covering the land with crop straw or burying deep the powder of the straw.The country has initiated a five-year action plan on conservation tillage in the northeastern black soil region. By the end of this year, the land area that adopted conservation tillage is expected to top 6 million hectares, and the figure will reach 9.3 million hectares by 2025, accounting for about 70 percent of suitable farmland in this region.PROMOTING CIRCULAR AGRICULTUREAt the Lubang Planting Cooperative in Zhongxiang City, central China\'s Hubei Province, Li Peng and his brother have formed a cycle of organic farming after years of experimentation to tap into the massive healthy food market.By feeding cattle with corn, raising earthworms with cattle manure, nourishing soil with fertilizer produced by earthworms, and feeding geese with leftover vegetables, the farm has made its production sustainable and economical.Taking soil fertility as its priority, the Green Fire Ecological Farm in the Miyun District of Beijing further expanded the sphere of the ecological chain for farming.Cooperating with a nearby dairy factory and a cattle farm, it made organic fertilizer rich in plant protein from expired milk and collected biogas residue fermented from cattle manure for land cultivation. It also recycled its own waste by crushing and fermenting organic vegetable and fruit straw to make natural fertilizer.\"We\'d like to restore the organic planting method with the help of modern technology and bring back the natural taste of farm produce,\" said Hou Binbin, head of the farm. \"Organic products are popular as people are paying more attention to food safety nowadays.\"Last year, the farm\'s organic product sales in Beijing topped 50 million yuan (about 6.94 million U.S. dollars), jumping over six times from 2017. Its customers also expanded from young moms to more groups, including senior citizens and young people.\"Having higher demand for quality life, Chinese people are more into a healthy diet,\" Kong said. \"Healthy food and healthy land have become indispensable.\"Earlier this year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs urged efforts to pilot a green cycle of planting and breeding, develop ecological farming, and cultivate a batch of national ecological farms to promote rural revitalization.\"The output of ecological farming is not at the cost of soil fertility,\" said Shi Yan, head of the Beijing Shared Harvest Organic Farm. \"It is a sustainable way of production that can last for decades, centuries, or even longer.\"', 'moms expired soil straw farmland corn organic hunting earthw', '2023-07-07', 'By Zhao Yang, Cheng Yunjie (Xinhua) 13:11, July 07, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Xiaoxuan, a former deputy to the National People\'s Congress, China\'s', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041102.html');

(Xinhua/Chen Xinbo)BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Freshwater jellyfish were spotted in the limpid water of Beijing\'s Huairou reservoir earlier this year -- a rare sight for local hydrologists as this aquatic life form had disappeared from the capital city for more than 20 years.\"I was totally amazed at seeing freshwater jellyfish in Huairou,\" recalled Guo Wei, laboratory director at the Beijing Hydrology Center.With a bell-shaped body of about 1.5 centimeters in diameter, this tiny and short-lived aquatic species is known to be very particular about its dwelling: a pellucid water body coupled with the right water temperature and a sound natural environment.\"The freshwater jellyfish is a veritable \'water-quality detector,\'\" Guo said.Besides Beijing, this fanatic for cleanliness has also been reported in the waters of other parts of China, including the city of Wuzhishan in Hainan, Dalian in Liaoning, and Chengdu in Sichuan Province.Other than freshwater jellyfish, endangered aquatic animals such as finless porpoises are also recovering their populations in China\'s clearer rivers and lakes as the country has ramped up efforts to enhance water conservation.Water management has never been an easy task in China. Difficulties ahead include uneven water resource allocation, frequent floods and droughts, and the arduous task of nurturing its large population with just 6 percent of global freshwater resources.China needs to strike a delicate balance between guaranteeing growing water usage and human activities along the waterways and the imperative of addressing challenges such as water pollution, overfishing, and biodiversity loss.In 2021, a 10-year fishing ban was launched in pivotal waters of the Yangtze River to increase the populations of aquatic creatures.More than 200,000 fishermen from 10 provincial-level regions along the river thus bid farewell to their centuries-old way of life and moved ashore. Many of them later joined fish protection teams, patrolling along the river to stem illegal activities.\"I have to admit that my work is kind of strenuous, but I volunteered to shoulder the responsibility to ensure that our descendants can live along the Yangtze River with a good environment,\" said Zhang Song, who had earned a living by fishing since 2000, but later became a member of a local fish protection team in southwest China\'s Chongqing.China has also implemented river chief and lake chief systems, in which government heads are designated to be in charge of protecting water bodies within their jurisdiction. More than 1.2 million river chiefs and lake chiefs have been appointed so far.Preliminary progress has been achieved. The number of finless porpoises, a key species for measuring the ecological environment of the Yangtze River, reached 1,249, up 23.42 percent from five years ago, according to a scientific expedition in 2022.Other aquatic resources in the key waters of the Yangtze River have also recovered. A total of 193 varieties of fish were spotted in the area in the 2022 expedition, an increase of 25 varieties from 2020.Artificial breeding and release of rare aquatic species have also been carried out to help increase their populations in the wild.In March, China made a major breakthrough in the protection of the Yangtze sturgeon, an endangered species under first-class national protection, that was declared extinct in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in July last year.Natural ovulation and fertilization of the rare fish was observed in a test conducted in a tributary of the Yangtze in Sichuan, signifying that captive-bred sturgeons have the capability to reproduce naturally in the wild.Moreover, regular monitoring of aquatic species, including plankton, fish, birds and zoobenthos, has been rolled out in China to evaluate the biodiversity of water ecosystems.\"With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), we apply facial recognition to avian diversity monitoring in Beijing,\" said Liu Bo, head of the water ecological monitoring and evaluation department under the Beijing Hydrology Center.Last year, an AI-powered monitoring point at Guanting reservoir successfully identified the black-faced spoonbill, a globally endangered waterbird.China\'s water quality has also seen notable improvement in recent years as the country shut down highly-polluting factories along rivers and ran environmental impact assessments.The water quality of the Yellow River\'s main stream stood at Grade II, the second-highest level in the country\'s five-tier water quality system, for the first time in 2022, while that of the main stream of the Yangtze River remained at Grade II for three consecutive years.With clearer rivers and lakes, hydrologists like Guo feel gratified and have more positive expectations for the future. The number of wild fish species in Beijing once dropped to about 40 from 85 due to poor water quality and other reasons. With the improvement of water ecology in recent years, fish species have been gradually recovering.\"In the near future, we may see more fish species revisiting the rivers in Beijing,\" Guo said.', 'species aquatic Yangtze rivers wild Freshwater Province sout', '2023-07-07', ' (Xinhua) 15:43, July 07, 2023', 'This aerial photo taken on June 20, 2023 shows the construction site of the water sourcing section', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:12:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041263.html');

For China-U.S. relations, which are at a historic low point, to break through rainstorms and embrace sunshine, both countries should work together in the same direction.Yellen\'s much-watched trip follows U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken\'s two-day stop in Beijing in June. Prior to her visit, Beijing and Washington have recently materialized a series of positive interactions, creating conditions for talks at more levels. These signs help shore up confidence that the momentum of communication and coordination is there.But for that momentum to retain and grow, people should bear in mind that acts of short-sightedness and a Cold-War mindset will easily damage any progress already made to rekindle bilateral ties.Both sides see the necessity to forge mutually beneficial economic and trade relations. To this end, politicians should see the bigger picture of China-U.S. ties, and avoid viewing this relationship through the lens of competition.A report earlier this month by U.S. news website Axios found that Corporate America still loves China, and economic imperatives are luring a steady stream of American business and tech moguls to China, including most recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.Pushing for so-called \"de-risking,\" another version of decoupling, would not fool the Chinese side to believe the United States has given up its efforts to contain China. The United States, despite repeatedly clamoring for it, cannot afford an economic decoupling from China, because it is \"disastrous,\" as Yellen warned months ago.Over the past year, the treasury secretary has frequently hinted at her willingness to visit China. The two nations \"can and need to find a way to live together\" despite strained ties over certain issues, she said.But that starts with Washington reviewing its unfair tariff policies and ditching its lose-lose protectionist practices.The harm arising from tariffs imposed by the former Trump administration was \"widespread, significant and counterproductive,\" the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations has found.The tariffs on China \"not only failed to achieve their objectives, but have hurt U.S. businesses and consumers along the way,\" it said.Yellen\'s visit comes at a time when Washington is intensifying its tech blockade against China, and fraying ties between the top two economies are roiling global markets.Days before her visit, China announced export restrictions on industrial products and materials containing gallium and germanium. Though Beijing has made it clear that the measure does not target any specific country, the decision is widely seen as a countermeasure to mounting U.S. high-tech restrictions under the pretext of baseless security grounds.It is unproductive when the United States is posturing for dialogue and communication, while tightening its block and containment against China. China will not accept a bullying offer.Perhaps, few in Washington seem to see more clearly than Yellen the importance of the U.S.-China economic bond. Americans \"benefit greatly\" from buying goods that are cheaper from China, she told the House Financial Services Committee in June. China equally benefits from U.S. exports that also bolster the U.S. economy.Over the decades, cooperation in various sectors has generated great benefits for both the Chinese and American people. And despite bilateral tensions and decoupling rhetoric, goods trade between the two countries hit a record 690.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, U.S. official data showed.The two countries enjoy extensive economic complementarity and intermingled interests. The respective success of the United States and China constitutes opportunities rather than challenges to each other.As the world\'s top two economies, China and the United States are also responsible to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, and adopt responsible and predictable macroeconomic policies.It\'s therefore hoped that the United States will prudently handle its interest rate policy and sovereign debt issue to prevent negative spillovers to other countries.There is no doubt that a stable and sound China-U.S. relationship is in the interests of the whole world. Thus Washington should join Beijing in upholding principles of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation, and exploring the right way to get along in the new era. That is how the two sides can ultimately dispel the dark storms still gathering over their relations.', 'countries Treasury China-U decoupling despite mounting showe', '2023-07-07', ' (Xinhua) 17:06, July 07, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A rainbow was seen across the sky after a sudden shower when U.S. Treasu', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:12:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041338.html');

However, the local government brought harmful projects of this sort to a halt in 2017, starting the restoration of the environment on the island.Li Yongwen, deputy general manager of Chongqing Guangyang Island Green Development Co., Ltd., said that on the basis of ecological restoration, the development potential of Guangyang Isle has also been unleashed through study tours, sports events and other eco-friendly services.The isle now has eight different kinds of study tour, involving interesting activities like counting stars in the night sky and searching for insects. So far, it has received more than 600,000 visitors, with over 700 on-site study tours carried out already.\"To learn about how Mother Nature works is a very valuable experience for the kids,\" said Wen Xiao, a parent participating in the tour. \"This is something that cannot be acquired by merely sitting in their classrooms.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('U.S. needs to show sincerity to improve ties with China - People\'s Daily Online', 'Guided by a Cold War mindset, the United States always believes it can pressure China on any issue so long as the lines of communication are kept open. This is a false belief Washington\'s politicians developed after the United States won the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Today, it is being applied on a new target -- China.They have been doing it on the Taiwan question: in August last year, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, claiming it should be supported to become a member of the \"democratic bloc\"; in May this year, Daniel Kritenbrink, a senior official with the Department of State, said the Taiwan question was not China\'s domestic affair, but a global concern.Yet at the same time, the United States repeatedly demanded open lines of communication with Beijing, as if they are free to run amok in the Taiwan Strait and Beijing must stay reachable on the phone. They made a mistake: the Cold War cannot be repeated when it comes to the Taiwan question. Taiwan, an inalienable part of China, is not a bargaining chip.Apart from the political farce, the United States has also been strengthening military deployment around Taiwan. There are now four new military bases in the region, enabled by pacts between America and the Philippines.According to an AFP story, a secret pact was signed in May between the United States and Palau that reinforced the operational power of American troops in Guam. Moreover, on June 12, a U.S. RC-135U reconnaissance aircraft conducted missions against the baseline of China\'s territorial airspace, only 30 nautical miles away from Shanghai at one point. Meanwhile, U.S. warships continued to flex muscles in the Taiwan Strait. While the U.S. keeps sounding the alarm over what they say is unsafe piloting of Chinese jets and vessels, it is the U.S. warships and jets that were operating far away from their homeland and making provocations on China\'s doorstep.Continued brinkmanship could cost the United States dearly. Before State Secretary Antony Blinken\'s visit to China, Minxin Pei, an American scholar, wrote in an essay in Bloomberg that the \"escalation dominance\" of the United States could defeat or cow China. He encouraged the U.S. government to intensify conflicts to a level that China cannot match. It is a bold idea but pure nonsense, more like a cheerleader\'s pompons than a well-considered professional judgement. China is not Iraq, and Chinese Taiwan is much less Ukraine. Colin Powell\'s washing powder will not produce much foam in the Taiwan Strait. And it remains doubtful whether the United States could maintain \"escalation dominance\" on China\'s doorstep given China\'s growing defense capability.In his in-depth talks with Chinese leaders, Blinken was reminded time and again of China\'s red line on the Taiwan question. He should take it seriously. If America does want to bring its ties with China back to the right trajectory, a result Blinken\'s visit was intended to deliver, it should show sincerity in action rather than pay lip service. It should stop flying all the way into China\'s neighborhood to make provocations.To some politicians, discipline is a foreign word. But the U.S. military must exercise caution in the East and the South China Seas. A military conflict in the Taiwan Strait will not benefit anyone. The United States should understand that.Editor\'s note: Xin Ping is a commentator on internationals affairs, writing regularly for Xinhua News Agency, Global Times, China Daily, CGTN, etc. He can be reached at xinping604@gmail.com.The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Xinhua News Agency.', 'Taiwan Chinas Strait enabled jets ties military Ping He flex', '2023-07-08', 'By Xin Ping (Xinhua) 09:52, July 08, 2023', 'Guided by a Cold War mindset, the United States always believes it can pressure China on any issue s', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:20:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0708/c90000-20041411.html');

(CNSA/Handout via Xinhua)BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have studied the lunar samples brought back by the Chang\'e-5 mission and found surges in volcanic activity on the moon about two billion years ago, offering a window into the moon\'s late-stage evolution.The study, conducted mainly by a research team at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published recently in the journal of Nature Communications.At the end of 2020, China\'s Chang\'e-5 mission retrieved samples from the moon weighing about 1,731 grams, which were the first lunar samples in the world in over 40 years.In the subsequent research, Chinese scientists dated the youngest rock on the moon at around 2 billion years in age, meaning that the period of lunar volcanism was between 800 and 900 million years longer than previously believed.\"This study further answered the question of how much magma spewed out during the moon\'s late period,\" said Tian Hengci, corresponding author of the study, told the China Science Daily.He added that the formation age of basalt, its geochemical characteristics and cooling timescales are critical to understanding the scale of a lunar magma eruption.Based on previous work, the research team found that the Chang\'e-5 basalt is likely to be the result of volcanic eruption during the same period, and as it came mostly from the same source, it provides an excellent opportunity to determine the thickness of the basalt lava flow and the scale of the eruption.Tian said that the cooling rate of magma is fastest at the surface, and it decreases gradually towards the interior. The cooling time and rate of magma can be deduced from changes in certain characteristic elements in minerals in the lunar samples, and based on this, the thickness of the lava flow and the scale of the eruption can be inferred.Researchers analyzed 21 olivine grains from basalt clasts, and the results indicate that the cooling time of most olivine particles was less than one year. Using a thermodynamic model, they estimated that the thickness of the basaltic lava flow was between 10 and 30 meters.Based on flat landing area of the Chang\'e-5, the research team extrapolated the volume of the basalt eruptions, and this indicated that there were large-scale magma eruptions on the moon about 2 billion years ago. The conclusions are consistent with the results obtained by remote sensing methods.According to the study, while the overall intensity of lunar volcanic activity may have decreased over time, there may have been episodic eruptions in the moon\'s late-stage with above-average flux.Researchers said that the reasons for the large-scale volcanic eruptions found during the late period of the moon are still unclear, and they will work with other teams to establish a thermal evolution model of the landing area to explore the mystery.', 'lunar magma samples volcanic scientists cooling eruptions mo', '2023-07-08', ' (Xinhua) 10:03, July 08, 2023', 'Photo provided by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) shows Chang\'e-5 probe gathering sa', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:20:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0708/c90000-20041418.html');

The conditions follow the strongest June heatwave in a decade, putting pressure on the power supply.The Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) on Thursday launched a level-four emergency response to flooding in the southern Chinese provincial regions of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Chongqing and Guizhou, with authorities issuing daily warnings of rain-triggered geological disasters and flash floods since the start of the week.FLOOD CONTROL ACTIVATEDA blue alert has been renewed in anticipation of downpours from 8 p.m. Friday to 8 p.m. Saturday, with heavy rain or rainstorms due in parts of Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shanghai.Local governments and residents have been advised to take appropriate precautions. Schools and kindergartens need to ensure the safety of students and children, while drivers should be alert and cautious due to waterlogged roads and traffic jams.As of Thursday night, the July rainstorms in southern China had claimed 17 lives in Chongqing Municipality, with 461,000 people affected in the neighboring Sichuan Province as of Tuesday.To support flood and geological disaster relief work in regions including Chongqing and Sichuan, China earmarked 320 million yuan (about 44.4 million U.S. dollars) on Wednesday from its central natural-disaster relief funds.Starting mid-July, the country will enter the critical month-long window of flood response, with its seven largest river basins, including the Yangtze River, Huaihe River and Yellow River, entering the main flood period.So far, both rainfall and river flooding have been moderate nationwide, according to the Ministry of Emergency Management (MEM). Still, it warns of inundation risks on some major rivers and lakes, windstorms and hail across China, as well as typhoons rampaging in southern and southeastern areas.Authorities are on the move. The MWR on Wednesday pledged to protect people\'s lives and prevent damage in reservoirs, important dikes and infrastructure. The Red Cross Society of China said it had sent task forces to guide flood control and disaster relief in Chongqing.

Since mid-June, an onslaught of red alerts for high temperatures in northern cities like Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and Jinan made social media headlines.The country is set to see the scorching heatwaves for the rest of July and August in regions including northern China and southwest China, weather forecasters say.The torrid heat brings risks of forest fires, traffic accidents, power and energy crunches, as well as heat-related illness. The National Meteorological Center said road-surface temperatures on expressways in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and beyond could be up to 62 degrees Celsius from Wednesday to Saturday, and has advised precautions in case of events like flat tires.China\'s power supply has been under pressure, with the recent peak load on electricity grids exceeding 900 million kilowatts. The China Electricity Council expects the nationwide peak load to hit 1.37 billion kilowatts this year, up 80 million kilowatts from 2022.The State Grid says it is ramping up the power supply by connecting a new 11.78-million-kilowatt generator module to the grid, while doubling down on emergency maintenance nationwide. The National Energy Corporation has made contingency plans for coal purchases, while major nuclear power and hydropower plants are ready for peak summer demand.The high temperatures have also caused droughts of varying degrees in breadbasket regions like Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei and Shandong, threatening agricultural production.

The twine will later be turned into hemp shoes, a traditional garment that has come into fashion in overseas markets, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Italy.\"I inherited this tool from my mom. In the past, almost every household made and wore hemp shoes in our village,\" said the 57-year-old worker.Wang was overjoyed when she learned that the old handicraft was now popular among foreigners, bringing her a monthly income of over 2,000 yuan (about 278 U.S. dollars).China is one of the first countries to cultivate hemp plants for making shoes. With its good moisture absorbance and durability, hemp has been used to make ropes, shoes and hats in China since ancient times.The tradition of making hemp shoes dates back a thousand years in Gangu County in the city of Tianshui, Gansu Province. In 2017, the traditional craft was recognized as an item of intangible cultural heritage within the province.The Gansu Yaluren hemp handicraft development company, where Wang works, participated in this year\'s Canton Fair, also known as the China Import and Export Fair.Niu Junjun, the company\'s chairman, is sanguine about their products\' sales prospects overseas. \"In the first quarter of this year, we sold more than 7 million yuan of hemp products. Many foreign trade dealers are interested in our products,\" he said.Niu, a native in Gangu County, has grown up wearing local hemp shoes. During his college years, he started to sell local specialties online via China\'s leading e-commerce platform Taobao. \"Hemp shoes were the most sought-after for their unique design and material,\" he recalled.In 2011, Niu and his wife Guo Juan returned to his hometown, specializing in selling hemp shoes while learning the old craft from scratch.\"The hemp shoes I wore when I was a child were comfortable enough, but the design was outdated. The key to success is more investment in developing new shoes and making innovations,\" Niu said. The company now pools more than 300,000 yuan annually into developing new designs.With more than 180 different styles launched, the company\'s hemp shoes have become a trendy item. In 2021, in collaboration with the renowned Palace Museum, the company designed and rolled out hand-made hemp shoes with signature elements from the museum\'s cultural relics.The local government has also provided the company with funding of more than 1 million yuan every year to support their vocational skills training and the further development of relevant industries.Since 2015, the company has launched free training courses for local residents, helping cultivate a group of inheritors of the ancient craft. \"We are in charge of providing local women with raw materials, the necessary techniques and orders for hemp products.

L0 provides various skills to meet the needs of different industry scenarios.The second layer, L1, provides a variety of industry-specific models, focusing on fields such as e-government, finance, manufacturing, mining and meteorology.The third layer, L2, provides multiple scenario-specific models for particular industry applications or business scenarios.Customers can also train models using their own datasets based on Huawei\'s L0 or L1 Pangu layers.The Pangu series was created to serve industry needs, providing excellent services to customers in various sectors, said Zhang Ping\'an, Huawei\'s executive director and CEO of Huawei Cloud. He added that Pangu\'s mission is to help customers effectively utilize and build large-scale models, enabling intelligent upgrades.First launched in 2021, Huawei\'s Pangu series is a family of multiple large AI models that support a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, text classification and conversation systems.Huawei said that the Pangu series has already been of immense value in numerous industries such as finance, manufacturing, pharmaceutical research and development, coal mining, and rail.On Thursday, a paper on a Pangu weather AI model was published in Nature, one of the world\'s top scientific journals. The paper described how to develop a precise and accurate global AI weather forecast system based on deep learning and train it using 43 years of weather data.In seconds, the model can accurately predict detailed meteorological features, including humidity, wind speed, temperature and sea level pressure, the paper said. This demonstrates Pangu\'s high precision compared to traditional numerical prediction methods for forecasts, which could take anywhere from an hour to a week, and its prediction speed is 10,000 times faster.The company has also launched its Ascend AI cloud services, through which a single-card computer cluster can provide 2,000 petaflops of computing capacity, and a 1,000-card cluster can train a multi-billion parameter model for an uninterrupted 30 days. Huawei said that more reliable AI computing power has made large language models more accessible than ever to industry customers.', 'AI latest launches tech models Customers and giant launched ', '2023-07-08', ' (Xinhua) 10:13, July 08, 2023', 'GUANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese tech giant Huawei on Friday launched the latest version of its', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:20:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0708/c90000-20041424.html');

(Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)Poverty reduction and environmental improvement must go hand in hand. Ecological civilization entails incorporating environmental considerations into all forms of social progress.GUIYANG, China, July 9 (Xinhua) -- South of the Yangtze River, southwest China\'s Guizhou Province is a realm of biodiversity, karst landscape and natural heritage. In the province\'s capital city Guiyang, a two-day global forum on ecological civilization just concluded.As a national-level global forum themed on ecological civilization, the Eco Forum Global Guiyang 2023, which attracted over 3,200 participants, provided a platform for international discussion on ecological civilization and green development.FIGHTING CHALLENGESGuizhou, a mountainous region, has overcome ecological degradation and severe economic distress to become what it is today.At the forum, participants were welcome to taste the locally-produced Roxburgh rose juice. This small and sweet fruit has a remarkable history of fighting against rocky desertification.Rocky desertification, also known as \"the earth cancer,\" refers to land degradation where vegetation is destroyed, bedrock is exposed and the surface resembles a desert landscape. Local people would say, \"Rocks come to light, no plants survive.\"In Guizhou, areas of rocky desertification are often located in impoverished regions. People discovered that Roxburgh roses are relatively cold-resistant, shade-tolerant and have well-developed root systems, making them naturally appropriate for combating rocky desertification.With government support, local people in areas of rocky desertification areas such as Liupanshui City, Bouyei-Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Qiannan, Anshun City and Bijie City started to grow Roxburgh roses in stone cracks and make products out of its fruits, which not only improved natural conditions but also helped people find a path to wealth.Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, once visited the Roxburgh rose planting areas in central Guizhou. He underscored that this solution for combating rocky desertification has economic value and inspires the world.This is just one example of the numerous instances where Guizhou showcases the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. Through years of dedicated efforts toward building a more eco-friendly society, Guizhou was designated the country\'s ecological civilization pilot zone in 2016.Thorjorn Larssen, deputy managing director of the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, came to China for the first time in 1993. He recalled that when he first came to Guiyang 30 years ago, the air pollution in the city was quite severe. \"It\'s very impressive to see how the air quality has improved and how fast measures are taken.\"According to the professor, poverty reduction and environmental improvement must go hand in hand. Ecological civilization entails incorporating environmental considerations into all forms of social progress.This photo taken on July 9, 2023 shows the closing ceremony of the Eco Forum Global Guiyang 2023 in Guiyang, southwest China\'s Guizhou Province. (Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)COMMON GOALSThe pursuit of ecological civilization in China matters to the world because no country or continent can manage environmental issues alone.In his congratulatory letter to the Eco Forum Global Annual Conference Guiyang 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, \"ecological conservation concerns the future of humankind, and it\'s the common goal of all nations to build a green home.\"Examples such as the commitment to achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality, as well as the promotion of initiatives like the Kunming Biodiversity Fund, demonstrate that China is dedicated to building a beautiful China and shouldering global responsibilities.\"We face roughly the same issues worldwide,\" said Tamas Hajba, senior advisor for China with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"It\'s very important that we measure biodiversity loss and exchange information and data with each other, and this is the way how we improve our own policies,\" he added.Furthermore, China\'s experience, accumulated over generations and in diverse geographical conditions, is valuable for those facing similar challenges.Solutions in tandem with the Sustainable Development Goals provide a global roadmap that protects the planet but also reduces poverty and leaves no one behind, James George, deputy resident representative of the United Nations Development Programme in China, told Xinhua.\"We are working closely together with China and all partners globally to develop new innovative development actions. Let us utilize this opportunity to share the best practices and new innovative approaches in China that we can share with the rest of the world for mutual exchange and learning for a better planet for everyone,\" he said.Michia Moncho, a full-time national community member of the Young Communist League of South Africa responsible for international relations, was impressed by what she saw in China. Besides theorizing \"development,\" what matters is to work with people and show them that ecological civilization is not only going to benefit us for now but for generations to come, she noted during the eco forum.\"I\'ll take home what I saw here, how China is implementing measures with Chinese characteristics, and we, as South Africans, can implement them with our characteristics,\" she said.Artists sing songs of Dong ethnic group at the closing ceremony of the Eco Forum Global Guiyang 2023 in Guiyang, southwest China\'s Guizhou Province, July 9, 2023. (Xinhua/Yang Wenbin)LEADING ROLEIn recent years, China has been leading in addressing climate change, protecting biodiversity and promoting a green transformation. The green technologies developed in China have benefited other parts of the world.In his written statement for the World Leaders Summit at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2021, Xi said it is vital to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade the energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern.\"We will foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emission projects,\" he said.Erik Solheim, former executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, told the eco forum that according to his observation, several Chinese companies are leading the way in future green industries, some even being established in third-tier small cities.These companies, such as those in the electric vehicle industry, \"brought jobs, prosperity, and profits in China, while at the same time, it is very good for global environmental progress,\" Solheim said.A few days earlier in Camacari, Brazil, Chinese automaker BYD announced the construction of a production base complex comprising three factories, which is expected to create over 5,000 new jobs in the local area. In addition to producing electric vehicles, the complex will process lithium-iron phosphate batteries.Filipe Porto, a researcher at the Federal University of ABC and a member of the Brazilian Foreign Policy Observatory, believes China is becoming an essential partner for Brazil to meet its decarbonization and energy needs.In Africa, China has been working with countries to meet their green targets.\"China has been the leading partner in the continent\'s desired to switch to solar and wind energy,\" said Cavince Adhere, a Kenya-based international relations scholar.The expert told Xinhua that with China\'s help, Kenya is now home to the largest grid-connected solar power plant in East and Central Africa. The Garissa China-built 50MW solar power plant is proving benefits to the country as Kenya now taps over 2 percent of the national energy source from the facility.Adhere said that through targeted technology transfers, Kenyans in the northern part of the country are now reaping the benefits of Chinese technology with improved access to power.', 'Weihua the Guiyang Ecological Guizhou civilization Province ', '2023-07-10', 'By Guo Yuqi (Xinhua) 08:05, July 10, 2023', 'This photo taken on July 8, 2023 shows an installation combined with several screens at Eco Forum G', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041521.html');

The Icebreaker Mission paved the way for the 1954 trade mission to China by 48 businessmen from British companies, which later became known generically as the 48 Group.\"The more time goes by, the more one can see how far-sighted the original icebreakers were,\" Bennett said. \"When there are people of vision and courage, you can make progress even in the most difficult times. That\'s what we need.\"In Bennett\'s view, a lot has changed from the time of the Icebreaker Mission and there is a great deal of openness on the part of the British business community to the country\'s relations with China.However, the so-called \"de-risking\" is a \"wrong term,\" he pointed out.\"You only need de-risking if there\'s a risk ... To me, China is an opportunity, not a risk,\" Bennett stressed.This photo taken on June 9, 2023 show a view of China Hainan Free Trade Port -- the U.K. Promotion Conference in London, Britain.

These cases illuminated China\'s practices in advancing ecological conservation and promoting rural revitalization.This year\'s event, themed \"pursuing modernization of harmony between humanity and nature -- promoting green and low-carbon development,\" has attracted over 2,500 participants with both online and offline activities.In an interview with Xinhua, James George, deputy resident representative of the United Nations Development Programme in China, stressed the importance of ecological conservation in promoting rural revitalization.\"Deterioration of ecological environment will lead to poverty, and poverty will accelerate the deterioration of the ecological environment as you can not address them in isolation,\" he said, noting that pursuing economic growth without paying attention to environmental protection will lead to a vicious cycle.Attaching great importance to environmental protection, Huawu Village, a once nationally designated poor village, has shaken off poverty and become a pilot project in developing rural ecological tourism.Located near the source of the Wujiang River in the western part of Guizhou, the natural environment of the small village of Miao ethnicity has improved thanks to concerted efforts of water pollution control, ecological restoration and a fishing ban in the Wujiang River basin.Targeting the attraction of splendid mountain views and vast water bodies, in addition to a unique ethnic Miao culture, the village has made great efforts in developing rural tourism. It has been active in building tourism infrastructure, such as roads, parking lots, campsites and guest houses, producing distinctive agricultural products and exhibiting traditional Miao embroidery.Local residents have received the dividends of ecological tourism. Since 2021, tourists have made over 900,000 trips to the village. The combined tourism income of the village exceeded 300 million yuan, with per capita net income reaching 25,000 yuan.\"Targeted initiatives in China that acknowledge local natural assets, explore new livelihood opportunities and take into account the domestic economic challenges, have enabled more policies and actions to be grounded,\" said George.The key moving forward is also scaling up the best practices and leveraging insights from the lessons learned to accelerate progress towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in China, he said.As a world leader in renewable energy development, China\'s robust progress in this field has also brought benefits to rural residents.In the Yi-Hui-Miao Autonomous County of Weining, which is near the peak altitude of Guizhou, it is hard to plant crops due to the high altitude. In recent years, new opportunities for local growth emerged as the province accelerated the development of new-energy power generation.Covering an area of more than 1,300 mu (about 86.67 hectares), the Jinyuan Meihuashan agricultural photovoltaic power station can generate 53 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each year.\"Photovoltaic panels can help block sunlight and reduce water evaporation, so the vegetation at the photovoltaic base grows better,\" said Tian Haokun, head of the station.Photovoltaic power generation not only saves energy and reduces carbon emissions, but also helps with soil and water conservation on barren hills and prevents the expansion of desertification, Tian added.The income of local villagers has significantly increased as the station pays a large amount in land rent to them each year and offers plenty of job opportunities. The grass flourishing under the photovoltaic panels also provides quality pasture for herding.From 2012 to 2022, the total installed capacity of clean energy reached 3.68 million kilowatts in the county of Weining, with a cumulative power generation of 29.4 billion kWh and an industrial output of 14.6 billion yuan.The significant rise of industrial output and tax revenue has provided the once poverty-stricken county with more funds to invest in projects aiming at improving local residents\' livelihoods.', 'rural ecological tourism energy enabled photovoltaic lucky V', '2023-07-10', ' (Xinhua) 08:32, July 10, 2023', 'GUIYANG, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Luo Wenmei, a resident of Qingshan Village in southwest China\'s Guizhou', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041594.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Migratory bird conservation enriches vision of shared future for all - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- When she spotted the first flock of Beijing swifts hovering above the Beihai Park this year, Zhang Liting was extremely excited to see that her \"old friends\" had completed their thousand-mile journey.The 39-year-old volunteer goes to the Beihai Park observation site at least once a week to record populations of Beijing swifts, providing tracking data and helping the birds migrate safely.The Beijing swift, or the Apus apus pekinensis, is a typical migratory bird. These birds leave Beijing in mid-July to overwinter in South Africa, and return to Beijing in late April the following year.Bird migration flyways are the stable routes that birds travel along between breeding and wintering sites. Four of the nine major bird migration flyways in the world pass through China.Harboring rich biodiversity, including more than 1,400 species of birds, China plays an irreplaceable role in global migratory bird conservation. Thanks to the country\'s continued efforts to preserve biodiversity and conserve green ecosystems, an ever-growing number of people are joining in on migratory bird protection work.BUILDING BIRD-FRIENDLY CITIESBeijing is a key point along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF), one of the world\'s great flyways for migratory birds. It is an important stopover site for birds such as grey cranes and black storks, as well as Beijing swifts, on their northbound trips in the spring.The latest list of Beijing\'s terrestrial wildlife shows that the city boasts 515 varieties of wild birds, ranking second among all the capital cities of G20 countries.Amid efforts to ramp up the construction of an ecological civilization in Beijing, the natural environment and various wildlife species are being increasingly integrated into the fast-growing megacity with a population of over 20 million.As of now, Beijing has established 79 protected nature areas, with the total areas reaching 368,000 hectares, bringing over 90 percent of key state-protected wildlife species and their habitats recorded in the city under effective protection. In 2021, the capital\'s forest coverage rate was 44.6 percent, and the green coverage rate of its urban areas was 49 percent.Beijing\'s appreciation for and awareness of birds has skyrocketed in recent years. Many activities are held in public spaces and schools to promote the importance of protecting birds. Bird-friendly buildings are a common sight, and methods to prevent birds from crashing windows are improving.\"With the restoration of the ecological environment and rising public awareness, people and birds, hopefully, can become the best neighbors living under the same sky,\" said Jia Yifei, an associate professor at Beijing Forestry University.REVITALIZING BIRD HABITATSIn late March, a flock of black-faced spoonbills was seen foraging on the shores of east China\'s Fujian Province.These birds have black and spoon-like beaks, and are one of the world\'s most endangered birds. They normally breed between May and July in northern regions and migrate southward to their winter roosting wetlands in October.\"The black-faced spoonbills were once rare to see here, but now they can be spotted every year and the number has remained stable,\" said Zheng Zhiwu, a birdwatcher who has been spotting birds at Luoyuan Bay in east China\'s Fujian Province for more than 20 years.Decades ago, the disorderly expansion of aquaculture farms once posed a great threat to the birds and damaged the ecosystem. To restore their habitat, the local government of Fujian has carried out multiple projects to restore key ecosystems, and transformed many fish-breeding ponds into bird habitats.The profound change in Luoyuan Bay epitomizes China\'s ecological restoration efforts.China in 1992 became a party to the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental agreement dedicated to the conservation and rational use of wetland ecosystems, and the country has since stepped up its conservation efforts while establishing a legal framework to govern wetlands.During the 2016-2020 period, China undertook 53 wetland protection and restoration projects, and more than 2,000 wetland ecological compensation projects. It also undertook projects to return farmlands to wetlands, as well as wetland protection and restoration subsidy projects.Over the past decade, China has added or restored more than 800,000 hectares of wetlands, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.The growing number of migratory birds seen in China speaks to an improving local natural environment, Zheng said. \"Endangered birds have become frequent visitors thanks to the improved natural environment,\" he added.PROTECTION TRANSCENDING BORDERSFlyways usually stretch across thousands of kilometers, spanning countries, oceans and continents. The EAAF, for example, stretches from the Russian Far East and Alaska, southward through East Asia and Southeast Asia, and on to Australia and New Zealand, encompassing over 20 countries and regions.\"Thriving migratory species need support from all countries along the entire flyway, so enhancing international cooperation is a must,\" said Guan Lei, a project manager at the Beijing Entrepreneur Environmental Protection Foundation.However, experts warn that the protection of migratory birds and their flyways continues to face threats such as the loss and fragmentation of habitats, insufficient funding, and regional imbalances. \"Only by working together to conserve their habitats can we provide more effective protection for the birds,\" Jia said.China has always been a strong advocator for strengthened global cooperation. It has signed bilateral agreements on migratory bird conservation with countries such as Japan and Australia, and promotes migratory bird protection through multilateral environment treaties. Last year, China pledged to promote international exchanges and cooperation to protect the four flyways that pass the country.Making big headway in that direction, China\'s Migratory Bird Sanctuaries along the coast of the Yellow Sea-Bohai Gulf (Phase I) were inscribed on the World Heritage List as a natural site in 2019.\"This inscription not only helps promote global efforts to protect the EAAF, but also injects vitality into the construction of a community for all life on Earth,\" Guan said.Zhang Liting said she was gratified to see her 13-year-old daughter become a loyal bird guardian. \"I believe Beijing swifts will make beautiful memories for future generations too,\" she said.', 'birds Migratory their flyways Fujian number countries projec', '2023-07-10', ' (Xinhua) 09:29, July 10, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- When she spotted the first flock of Beijing swifts hovering above the Be', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041706.html');
INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Japan must not take IAEA report to shield its ocean discharge - People\'s Daily Online', 'The Japanese government obviously got excited after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a comprehensive report on the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, taking the report as a shield that keeps off opposing voices against its plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water into the sea.However, this carefully worded report failed to fully reflect views from experts that participated in the review. The conclusion was not shared by all experts and failed to review the justification and legitimacy of Japan\'s ocean discharge plan. The attempt of the Japanese side is doomed to end up in vain.The report cannot give legitimacy to Japan\'s plan of discharging nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean.Japan\'s unilateral decision to dump nuclear-contaminated water into the Pacific is based entirely on minimizing economic cost, and will transfer risks to the whole world. Japan is the only beneficiary of the decision, while other countries in and near the Pacific will be forced to shoulder risks and spend huge amount of resources in coping with possible negative situations.When the Japanese side requested the IAEA to review its discharge plan two years ago, it has excluded other safer and better plans. The IAEA only reviewed the plan that the Japanese side submitted.The report said that the responsibility for justifying the decision to discharge the treated water falls to the Japanese government, which is significantly important for stakeholders. Japan\'s discharge plan was not recommended or endorsed by the IAEA.The report cannot fully prove that it\'s safe and harmless to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station to the ocean.The nuclear-contaminated water contains over 60 radionuclides, and there is not yet effective technology to treat many of those radionuclides. The effectiveness and maturity of Japan\'s Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) has not been evaluated or certified by a third party, and the facility has repeatedly malfunctioned.According to data released by Japan, over 70 percent of ALPS-treated nuclear-contaminated water failed to meet the discharge standards. Japan\'s discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water will last as long as 30 years or even longer. How can it prove the long-term reliability of the ALPS? Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has a record of manipulating data and concealing accidents. How can the review based on statistics and information provided by this company assure the international community? The report said that the conclusions on safety was reached based on Japan\'s discharge plan and will establish a long-term mechanism that monitors the discharge, which exactly proves the long-term risks of discharging the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean.The report cannot exempt the Japanese side from its due responsibilities and obligations under international law.The international community is concerned about Japan\'s discharge plan because it fears that Japan would transfer the risks of nuclear contamination to the rest of humanity, which is inconsistent with Japan\'s obligations under the international law.Some long-lived radionuclides may spread with the ocean currents. What impacts will they have on the ecological balance of coastal waters of Japan\'s neighboring countries? Whether will they form a bio-concentration and pose potential hazards to food safety and human health with the migration of marine species and the food chain? No one has given convincing answers to these questions, be it the Japanese side or the IAEA.Besides, such discharge violates Japan\'s obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment as outlined in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international law and the provisions against dumping radioactive wastes from man-made structures at sea in the London Convention. The Japanese side cannot deny the fact that such discharge is suspected of violating its international obligations no matter how it whitewashes its intention.The Japanese side is trying to hype the voice that distrusting the report is harming the authoritativeness of the IAEA. However, the biggest harm to the organization\'s authoritativeness came from Japan\'s efforts to limit the organization\'s authorization in reviewing the discharge plan, which finally led to incomplete and conditional conclusions of the report.A recent poll in Japan shows that 40 percent of the respondents oppose discharging the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. A joint survey by South Korean newspaper Hankook Ilbo and Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun also revealed that more than 80 percent of South Koreans disagree with Japan\'s discharge plan.Experts and citizens from Pacific island countries, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Africa and Peru have staged frequent protests against the discharge plan, and the Chinese people are strongly opposing Japan\'s practice.Regrettably, Japan has turned a blind eye to this and stubbornly announced that it would start discharging the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean as scheduled this summer. It slandered other countries\' legitimate concerns and even mentioned water discharge from normal operation of nuclear power plants and dumping nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean in the same breath. This clearly is not what a responsible country does.Japan has the responsibility and obligation to offer an explanation to the world on its discharge plan, which is a major issue that concerns the public interests of the international community.It should be clear that the IAEA report cannot quiet the doubts of the world about its discharge plan, or become a “shield” or “greenlight” for the plan.The country should faithfully fulfill its moral responsibility and obligations under international law, stop pushing forward the ocean discharge plan, fully study alternatives to the ocean discharge, carry out full consultation with neighboring countries and other stakeholders, and earnestly dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a science-based, safe and transparent manner.(Zhong Sheng is a pen name often used by People\'s Daily to express its views on foreign policy and international affairs.)', 'japan,IAEA', '2023-07-10', 'By Zhong Sheng (People\'s Daily) 09:30, July 10, 2023', 'The Japanese government obviously got excited after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) re', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041722.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Commentary: Mending fences with China entails Washington\'s resolve to dispel misconceptions - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- China-U.S. interactions have lately forged ahead and hence some common understandings, signifying positive development towards a detente between the world\'s two largest economies.Yet, it is important to stay lucid and recognize that given the various challenges in China-U.S. relations, a significant detente is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly achieved by a mere command of the will.Their political, economic as well as people-to-people exchanges have sunk to their nadir in decades, owing largely to the major misconceptions in America\'s China policy and its consequential moves.To stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations, the first and foremost prerequisite lies in Washington\'s will to shift its perception of China and adopt a rational approach to China\'s rise.The very essence of today\'s problems lies in the misjudgment of China by some U.S. politicians, and notably the bigoted bias against China harbored by Washington\'s China hawks. China endeavors to develop its economy to enable all Chinese to live a better life, rather than to threaten, challenge, or supplant any other countries.Framing China as a \"threat\" based on the unfounded fear of China competing for hegemony is utterly brainless, while deeming China as an imaginary enemy is a typical case of groundless anxiety.Washington also lacks adequate understanding of the resilience of the Chinese people. It is nothing but an illusion for the United States to deal with China \"from a position of strength,\" as China has never subscribed to the logic of \"might makes right.\" Any attempt to suppress China will only evoke a more resolute response from the Chinese people.Second, to mend fences between the two sides, consensus between the two heads of state during the G20 summit in Bali should be genuinely implemented.The exchange of views between the two heads of state in Indonesia has charted the course to steer the relationship back to a healthy and stable track.However, over the last few months, the United States has run counter to the spirit advocated by the consensus, taking a slew of actions detrimental to China\'s core interests, severely damaging the political foundation for the China-U.S. ties, polluting the environment for bilateral exchanges, and disrupting the agreed-upon dialogue and cooperation agenda.Implementing the Bali consensus entails adhering to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation.For China and the United States, respecting each other\'s development rights, properly managing the source of tensions, along with embracing cooperation rather than confrontation can ensure the steady and long-term development of their relations.Third, both sides must respect each other\'s core interests and major concerns, refrain from treading on each other\'s bottom lines, and manage differences and sensitive issues in a constructive, calm, professional, and rational manner.Particularly, the Taiwan question, which stands out at the very core of China\'s core interests, is the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations. On this question, China has no room for compromise.On other sensitive topics, China has made it clear that the specific differences between the two sides can be patched up through discussion, but only on the precondition of equality.For instance, the two countries take different paths in their respective national development: the United States practices capitalism while China adopts socialism. Such difference has been there since day one of the China-U.S. engagement and will continue to exist.For China and the United States to get along, it is vital to recognize and respect such differences. Washington\'s so-called \"democracy vs. authoritarianism\" narrative is an outdated awful fuss.Fourth, improving the relationship with China constitutes a responsibility that the United States should undertake towards the world.History has proven that China and the United States, when in concert, can accomplish much to both countries and the world. They joined forces in 2001 to combat terrorism, cooperated in 2008 to address the international financial crisis, and in 2016, played a crucial role in reaching the Paris Agreement on climate change.However, after Washington\'s China policy has been dominated by misconceived competition, its attempts to contain China, through wars on the fronts of trade, industry and technology, have taken a toll on not only the development of the two sides but also that of the wider world. The international community expects both sides to approach each other with a sense of responsibility, properly handle their differences, and find the right way to get along.In the future, there is great potential for their cooperation on a host of bilateral and global issues if Washington ditches its increasingly confrontational posture toward China.Fifth, Washington\'s attempt to contain China is destined to fall flat.China is bound to develop steadily because of its unique institutional advantages such as the whole-process people\'s democracy, a reliable and effective system fitted to China\'s realities. Its unstoppable progress also comes from its more than 1.4 billion industrious and intelligent people.Meanwhile, China actively integrates into the trend of the times, and shares prosperity and promotes peace with other countries. This is the historical logic of China\'s development and the root cause of China\'s increased influence. In the era of globalization, countries have interconnected interests. That\'s why most countries are reluctant to take sides, let alone be tied onto the chariot of confronting China.Washington\'s China approach underpinned by competition and confrontation has neither held China back nor made America great again, only to arouse resentment from across the world.

The 864 solar panels which span 1,800 square meters on the top of the building make a micro grid that boasts a total installed capacity of 345 kW and an annual generation capacity of 270,000 kWh. The micro grid powers not only the building itself, but also the charging poles in the residential complex. The clean electricity generated by the facility each year is able to charge more than 5,000 electric vehicles.\"It\'s a prefabricated building, and the construction of it was like building blocks. Parts needed were fabricated in factories and then transported to the site for assembly,\" said Zhu, adding that it was efficient and reduced environmental pollution.A citizen rides a shared electric bike in Lianyungang, east China\'s Jiangsu province. (People\'s Daily Online/Geng Yuhe)It is learned that Jiangsu province has built a batch of similar structures featuring ultra-low energy consumption. Constructed in green and low-carbon ways, they boast higher efficiency of energy utilization and lower carbon emissions.At 8:00 am on a Monday, when traffic was the busiest of the day, Chen Taizhou, bus driver of Line 1 of Jiangsu\'s Wuxi, drove a bus from Wuxi\'s central bus station to the destination Yuantouzhu, a local scenic tourist region.\"It was all jammed in the peak hours a few years ago, and I had to wait at traffic lights at almost every crossroads. Passengers always complained about it,\" said Chen, referring to a 5-kilometer section that crosses 10 intersections in the downtown.However, things have changed since last September. Chen found that he was seeing more green lights and less red ones when driving through the section, and the cycle length of red lights became shorter.The change came from Wuxi\'s innovative attempt to promote green transportation and public transit with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.Chen\'s bus is powered by new energy and looks very tech-ish. On the top of it there are two antennas, which help realize precise positioning of the vehicle with the differential positioning technology. Besides, the bus is also equipped with a smart gateway that transmits real-time data of the vehicle, including speed, mileage and positioning information.A technician checks the production of a full-automated production line in a factory of a construction materials company in Taicang, east China\'s Jiangsu province. (People\'s Daily Online/Ji Haixin)Three bus routes in the city now enjoy transit signal priority (TSP) at some 30 crossroads thanks to the application of the internet of vehicles, said an official with the municipal bureau of industry and information technology of Wuxi.According to the official, these buses now make 1.03 less stops during a single trip and their average waiting time at each crossroads has been reduced by 54 seconds, or 36.1 percent.Apart from Wuxi, other cities in Jiangsu province also launched TSP services and green bus routes, including Suzhou and Suqian. With better experiences, green public transport is seeing more and more passengers.In a factory of Globe Group in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, one of the leading Chinese manufacturers of new energy gardening machinery, solar panels were seen on the top of workshop buildings. Apart from the solar power facility, the factory also employs clean production techniques. It has established a resource recycling mechanism and is constantly optimizing the structure of energy consumption for better green development.Senior vice president of the company Zhuang Jianqing told People\'s Daily that the company, using government subsidies, launched green transition for its production, building two unmanned workshops, updating 50 automated production lines and introducing 240 robots. Besides, it has also established a circulating water treatment system. Thanks to these efforts, the factory has expanded its capacity by four times while being environmentally friendly.Over recent years, Jiangsu province has accelerated the green transition of traditional industries and increased its support for environmental protection, clean production and green service industries, building a batch of green high-tech factories featuring low energy consumption and low pollution.', 'Jiangsu,green', '2023-07-10', 'By Yao Xueqing, Bai Guangdi (People\'s Daily) 11:03, July 10, 2023', 'Jiangsu province in east China has made ceaseless efforts to foster green production and promote gre', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041863.html');

CHINA DAILYDriverless: Trials a solid foundation for commercial runA larger fleet of driverless taxis will soon be available for hire in the capital city as the Office of the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone has decided to launch the commercial operation of autonomous vehicles and expand their serviceable area.On Friday, authorities in Beijing made a policy decision to allow eligible companies to operate driverless taxis without safety supervisors on board and charge passengers for the rides, marking a definite step in commercialization of intelligent transportation.Self-driving taxis were rolled out on a trial basis in the capital in March following a series of road tests, which were conducted with safety supervisors on board.Chinese tech giant Baidu and autonomous mobility startup Pony.ai won permits back then to operate driverless taxis through their ride-hailing apps within a 60-square-kilometer area in Yizhuang, located in the southern suburbs of Beijing. The trial rides were free for passengers.Now, the Office of the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone plans to allow commercial operation of the driverless taxis in an area of 500 sq km. Interested companies are required to apply for commercial operation permits.According to the office, 116 self-driving taxis have been operating in Beijing on a trial basis for the past four months. They have completed over 1.5 million test trips, and the total length of the trips reached nearly 2 million km. More than 95 percent of passenger ratings have been favorable.All the preliminary tests and free trials have laid a solid foundation for the commercial launch of unmanned vehicles and provided a wealth of experience in unmanned demonstration applications, said Xu Hongwei, executive deputy director of the office.During the commercial run of driverless taxis, more attention will be paid to the assessment of service capabilities of autonomous mobility companies, with the focus being on reviewing three risk aspects — passenger safety, traffic conditions and autonomous driving functions, he said.At the same time, tailored daily supervision and emergency plans will be formulated for the unmanned commercial fleet to ensure that these vehicles run smoothly and safely on roads, he added.Dai Wanli, a 35-year-old Beijing resident, said she and her family took a ride in a driverless taxi in May at Shougang Park, one of the venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\"We booked a ride using a mobile phone app and followed instructions to the closest stop to board a self-driving taxi. We scanned the code, the door opened on its own and we hopped in,\" Dai said, pointing out that it was a very smooth ride, unlike some manned taxis.\"My son absolutely loved the ride. We\'ve seen other special projects in the industrial park, but this one is by far the most impressive,\" she said, adding that they planned to book another ride soon.Last month, Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said at a news conference that China has opened up a road network of more than 15,000 km to test intelligent vehicles, including taxis and buses, involving multiple self-driving scenarios such as autonomous valet parking and unmanned delivery.', 'taxis Driverless paid capital autonomous Office vehicles run', '2023-07-10', 'By Luo Wangshu (Chinadaily.com.cn) 14:01, July 10, 2023', 'Baidu and Pony.ai\'s autonomous driving vehicles test on the street in Yizhuang in Beijing\'s souther', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041972.html');

Cartoon: Vitaly PodvitskiRifts within the NATO alliance over the potential expansion of the bloc\'s presence in Asia Pacific ahead of the NATO summit next week have been exposed by strong opposition from French President Emmanuel Macron. Chinese experts believe NATO\'s intention to extend its tentacles into Asia Pacific region not only exposes the selfish purpose of the US, which plays a central role in the alliance, to impose its own hegemonic intention over other NATO members\' interests, but will further divide the group as in Europe, France may not stand alone in its opposition.This year marks the second consecutive year that leaders from both Japan and South Korea will attend the summit. Observers see it as a sign that the two countries are seeking closer ties to better coordinate Washington\'s strategic moves to contain China. Such a \"short-sighted\" move will surely trigger China\'s strong opposition and result in regional countries\' heightened vigilance.NATO leaders will meet in Vilnius, capital of Lithuania from Tuesday to Wednesday. This summit is earmarked as a moment for making progress on the plan to open a liaison office in Japan, which would represent the organization\'s first outpost in the region.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who is scheduled to participate in the summit for the second year in a row, will use the opportunity to stress the need for relations between Japan and NATO to be stronger, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Friday.NATO allies are in discussion about a possible statement with four Indo-Pacific countries - Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - that would set out deeper cooperation and reiterate that security in Europe is interlinked with security in the region, Bloomberg quoted a senior European diplomat as saying on Saturday.However, according to a report from Politico, Macron has voiced strong opposition, expressing concerns that opening a liaison office in Japan would shift NATO\'s focus too far from its original mandate in the North Atlantic.\"We are not in favor as a matter of principle,\" stated an official from the Elysée Palace during a press briefing on Friday. The official further emphasized that the Japanese authorities themselves have not expressed significant interest in the proposed office.Chinese experts said that French opposition may postpone NATO\'s move, but it may not be able to deter the alliance\'s growing tendency of getting more involved in Asia-Pacific matters.There is a wide consensus within NATO that the alliance should focus primarily on transatlantic security. However, to serve its global hegemonic purpose, the US, who takes center stage of the alliance, is pushing for the organization to shift to the Asia-Pacific region, mainly to contain China, Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday.The US and other NATO members are divided over whether to expand its role in Asia, said Li, pointing out that amid the background of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, some European countries are worried that such a move will dilute the organization\' attention on the crisis.Speaking during a special session at the IISS Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last month, NATO\'s assistant secretary-general for defense policy and planning Angus Lapsley said that the alliance does not wish to operate or expand in the Indo-Pacific, but it wants to be involved and engaged in the region to gain a better understanding of happenings in this part of the world, the Straits Times reported.Pushing NATO to extend its role into Asia Pacific not only exposes the US\' selfishness of imposing its own hegemonic goals over other members\' national security, it will also risk dividing the alliance, as some NATO members may be reluctant to follow suit, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.It would be a \"very hostile move\" to open a liaison office in Japan, Chinese experts said. The discussion comes at a time when the US is seeking to keep high-level communication lines open with China as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen just concluded her visit to China, who noted that the US does not seek to \"decouple\" from China.At the same time that US politicians are uttering sweet words to assure China that US is not to seek decoupling from Beijing, on the other hand, it is sparing no effort to marshal its allies to counter China in the region. These self-contradictory moves are deeply disturbing, Li said. He noted that these actions reveal a lack of sincerity and credibility by Washington to fix China-US relations.US vassalsLeaders from South Korea and Japan will hold a meeting on the sidelines of a NATO summit in Lithuania next week, South Korea\'s presidential office said on Sunday.Similar to Japan\'s eagerness to welcome NATO to expand to Asia Pacific, South Korea, which is leaning more closely toward the US, is also allying itself closer to US-led small cliques in order to counter China.Song pointed out that a meeting between Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol is set to further mend disputes between two countries and forge closer military ties to better serve Washington\'s goal of a trilateral alliance in the region. However, Song said different from Japan\'s taking proactive gesture of welcoming NATO, South Korea to some extent has been hijacked by the US to serve the latter\'s interest.In January, Jens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO, urged South Korea to \"step up\" military support for Ukraine, citing other governments that have changed their policies on exporting weapons to Ukraine. Ever since the start of the Ukraine war, pressure has been building on Seoul to send its arms to Kiev, from the US, UK and EU member states.Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, described South Korea and Japan\'s attaching themselves to the US\' chariot as a \"short-sighted and dangerous\" move, as standing at the front line of US containment of China will also put themselves on the front line of China\'s countermeasures.Moreover, inviting extraterritorial military alliances into the Asia-Pacific region arouses heightened vigilance by regional countries, which crave stability, Lü said.Speaking in June at a graduation ceremony for students, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said, \"NATO only exists in the West, and now it seems to be involved in the Asia-Pacific region in various activities, bringing concerns for ASEAN,\" Cambodian media reported.', 'office alliance closer region expand summit countries opposi', '2023-07-10', 'By Zhao Yusha (Global Times) 14:41, July 10, 2023', 'Japan, the first feeder of NATO in Asia.

The cost of each AM is just 1 U.S. dollar, making it viable for long-term and large-scale monitoring of nuclear wastewater.As of today, AMs have already been in use in 29 countries and regions around the world, the EdUHK said in a press release earlier this month.\"The risks posed by nuclear wastes to marine ecology and human health cannot be underestimated ... The device can play a role in safeguarding environmental and food safety, as it offers authorities around the world a practical and cost-effective way to monitor radionuclides in waters,\" said Wu.In addressing the problem of radioactive pollution in the ocean, Wu and his team in 2022 selected three radioactive substances -uranium, strontium, and caesium commonly found in nuclear waste and disposal, as research targets.The research team then placed the AMs in seawater containing various concentrations of radionuclides, in an attempt to test the devices\' absorption and releasing abilities.Following a series of experiments, results showed that it only takes seven to eight weeks for the AMs to complete the absorption process.

(People\'s Daily Online/Hu Xiaofei)The second 10-million mark was crossed just 17 months later, Fu noted.With this record, the NEV sector has entered a new stage of large-scale, globalized and high-quality development after achieving industrialized and market-oriented development, and is becoming an important part of China\'s modern industrial system, Fu said.China has issued a series of supporting policies in finance, taxation, integral management and traffic management to spur NEV development. At the same time, Chinese carmakers have developed a number of new technologies and products to grasp the opportunities of market transformation, meeting new consumption demands.As a result, the country\'s production and sales volumes for NEVs have both ranked first worldwide for eight years in a row, and Chinese NEVs now make up over 60 percent of the global market.China has witnessed rapid growth in the NEV market. Last year, nearly 6.89 million NEVs were sold in China, up 93.4 percent from a year ago.

(Photo provided by Lin Yi\'nan)Since the 1880s, large batches of foreign expatriates moved to Fuzhou, southeast China\'s Fujian province. Many of them would spend the summer in Kuliang, or what\'s known as Guling in Mandarin, a popular place for summer vacation located on the outskirts of Fuzhou.There, they built villas, hospitals, tennis courts, swimming pools, postal offices and many other facilities, and established a deep bond with local residents.Recently, Kuliang welcomed many old friends from the United States attending the \"Bond with Kuliang: 2023 China-U.S. People-to-People Friendship Forum.\" Some of them spent their childhood in Kuliang with their parents, and some boast close relations with the Chinese small town through their families. Kuliang is like a bond that connects them with China.Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the forum. \"I was very glad to hear from members of the Kuliang Friends, and to know from your letter more touching stories about your connection with Kuliang,\" said Xi in the letter.In 1901, U.S. citizen Milton Gardner came to Fuzhou as an infant with his parents and stayed until his family moved back to the United States in 1911. Gardner had been longing for revisiting his childhood home, but had never been able to make his wish fulfilled before passing away.In 1992, Xi, who was then secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned about this touching story from an article titled \"Ah! Kuliang.\" He then invited Milton Gardner\'s widow, Elizabeth Gardner, to visit China, so as to help fulfill her husband\'s lasting wish.Since then, the Kuliang story has become well-known to many.An aerial view of Kuliang. (Photo/Lin Shuangwei)Lee Gardner, grandnephew of Milton Gardner, told People\'s Daily that his whole family is grateful to Xi for realizing the dream of a senior American, adding that the Kuliang story has touched many people in the United States.According to the man, who has visited Kuliang four times, his grandfather and father were both born in Kuliang, and the place was their homeland and also Lee\'s second hometown. He said the words of love are universal though in different languages.He showed to People\'s Daily a photo album kept by his family, which records the deep bond between the Gardners and Kuliang. He said the album is the most valuable treasure of his family and would be presented to the Chinese people as a gift this time he came to Kuliang.Gail Harris, who once lived in Kuliang as a child, said in Fuzhou dialect \"I\'m home\" as she once again set foot on the land of Kuliang for the forum.Her grandfather Harry Russell Caldwell was an expert on the ecological environment of Fujian province and compiled South China Birds, a book studying bird populations in Kuliang. It\'s one of the earliest modern scientific works recording China\'s bird species.Harris noted that Caldwell loved China and the Chinese people, and now his grandchildren have also fallen in love with this country, adding that she very much misses and loves the time she spent in China.Lee Garnder holds a photo album that records his family\'s bond with Kuliang. (People\'s Daily/Wang Yinxin)This time, Harris met her childhood friend Li Yiying. They sat down and exchanged slowly, word by word, in Fuzhou dialect. The two friends greeted each other, with hands clasped together.Harris said that she hopes the bond in Kuliang could be passed down from generation to generation, so that love and friendship will live on forever.Octogenarian Priscilla Brewster Gill came to attend the forum accompanied by her granddaughter Katy Barber, recalling the old streets and alleys she remembered from her childhood. China is the hometown where her heart belongs, Gill said.Gill was born in Fuzhou\'s Gutian. Her father Harold Brewster once ran a clinic in Kuliang and was the last foreign president of the current Fujian Medical University Union Hospital.Gill lived in China for 12 years and used to help her father take care of patients. She recalled her childhood when she fell down and got hurt, the local villagers would also help her with her wounds. She and the locals were like families, Gill said.Elyn MacInnis, 72, is a senior advisor of the Kuliang tourism and culture research association. Her husband Peter MacInnis was born in Fuzhou, and her father-in-law Donald MacInnis was once a member of the Flying Tigers, a group of volunteer American pilots who came to China and stood shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people to fight the Japanese invasion.Elyn MacInnis and her daughter use a bucket to draw water from a century-old well in Kuliang.

Today, the group has over 50 members and has grown into an important force driving non-governmental friendly exchanges between China and the United States.Amity between the people holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. The Kuliang story is a great example of the people-to-people friendship between China and the United States.Although the two countries are currently facing difficulties and challenges in their relations, they are in dire need of enhancing people-to-people exchanges.Elyn MacInnis told People\'s Daily that their elder generations lived in Kuliang in the past and got along well with the locals, and this piece of history just well presents the good qualities of mankind - understanding, respect, peace, friendship and love.She noted that the Kuliang story belongs to not only China and the United States, but also the whole humanity at large.

(Everland Resort/Handout via Xinhua)SEOUL, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda, leased by China to South Korea seven years ago, gave birth to the first pair of baby pandas in the country last week, Everland theme park said Tuesday.Ai Bao, a nine-year-old female, gave birth to the female twin cubs on Friday, according to Everland, South Korea\'s largest theme park in Yongin, some 40 km south of the capital Seoul.The elder and the younger cubs weighed 180 grams and 140 grams each. South Korea saw the first birth of a baby giant panda, named Fu Bao, on its soil in July 2020.Everland said that Ai Bao and her newborns remained in good condition. Ai Bao succeeded in natural mating with Le Bao, a 10-year-old male, in the middle of February.Giant pandas are known to rarely get pregnant as their breeding season only continues for one to three days per year usually in springtime.The twin cubs will not be unveiled to the general public for the time being. It usually takes five to six months for a cub to be able to adapt to an external environment.Everland said it will continue to show pictures and videos of the baby pandas through its SNS channels.The giant panda pair arrived in South Korea in March 2016 on a 15-year lease. Their names, Le Bao and Ai Bao, mean pleasant and lovely treasures.Everland built a 3,300-square-meter Panda World to accommodate the endangered species. The panda species was under threat of extinction but gained great popularity for lovely looks and rarity in the world.About 14 million people have visited the Panda World to see the panda family, according to Everland.The pandas were leased to South Korea for a joint research purpose.

CHINA DAILYWhile they find China\'s high global standing reassuring, college leavers are anxious about growing competition in the job market. The annual college graduation season is just drawing to a close. As most of this year\'s graduates were born in 2000 or 2001, they are the first of the \"00\'s generation\" to leave the campus and enter the workplace.These graduates also have a second defining characteristic: three of their four years of college life were dominated by the COVID-19 epidemic, so they stayed home to take online classes or were quarantined in their dormitories. Some said they were surprised to have graduated without having eaten in every one of their school\'s canteens.Those factors have left two marks on them: a sense of security engendered by the favorable economic environment that has cushioned their young lives, while conversely they are anxious after the epidemic and as a result of the growing competition for jobs.Zhang Xiaojing, who was born in September 2000, graduated from Beijing Jiaotong University with a bachelor\'s in internet journalism. Like her peers, she is skilled in the use of a range of news software, self-media platforms and social media apps. She took many online classes at home, and the huge amount of information flowing from the internet meant that even from her earliest days at university she learned to think, be discerning and plan.\"My generation is exposed to too much information, so when making future life choices, we need a stronger ability to sift through information. If you make a big life choice in a confused way, the risks are bigger than before,\" she said.With a plan for her future career in mind, she began an internship in the summer of her sophomore year. After trying five different companies and units including iQiyi, Tencent and traditional media she decided to undertake postgraduate study.\"I tried a few different jobs and fluctuated between the feeling that I was the right fit or the wrong fit. I need more time to look at it and try more things in different areas,\" she said.\"School is a very special period when we can learn social behavior and even make mistakes. We still have a lot of experience to gain, so we want to continue to obtain it as students, which I think comes at a relatively low cost. I will have to work for several decades, but my educational life is less than 20 years, so there\'s no hurry.\"A job fair for college graduates is held at the Hefei Sports Center in Anhui province on May 29. WANG YISHENG/FOR CHINA DAILYPractical experienceKong Zhiyu, Zhang\'s classmate, said that this year\'s graduates enjoyed their internships very much, and they believe that learning in school and practicing in the workplace are equally important ways of gaining experience. Even though they are not yet 23 years old, many say that they are already \"internship veterans\".He said that interning taught him a lot: in addition to improving his basic working ability, he is better at writing resumes after interacting with employers and he has identified the things he needs to do to supplement his knowledge and ability.\"The practical experience also made me more realistic,\" he said. \"In school, we don\'t have a clear idea of what kind of talent society needs or where we stand among our peers. But after working with employers, we tend not to be too shy or arrogant, we can find our own level and have more realistic expectations for the future.\"One of his peers, Wu Di, a Spanish major who graduated this year, said that today\'s college students are \"caught up\" and that the anxiety and insecurity they feel mainly come from peer pressure to work hard.Wu said his former classmates still feel uneasy and anxious, despite having consulted with their predecessors and teachers about their experiences, formulated future work plans and interned and interacted with employers since their early years in college.\"If you measure anxiety on a scale of zero to 10, this generation would register as eight to 10,\" he said.\"In recent years, we have felt that there are too many uncertainties in the world. When it comes to work and the future, it seems that the only certainty is making money. So when I made a career choice after graduation, the salary was the first factor I considered, followed by the growth brought by the job, realization of personal value and a few other things.\"Graduates hand in their resumes and question recruiting agents about work at the job fair. WANG YISHENG/FOR CHINA DAILY\'Sense of security\'In interviews for this article, the phrase \"Searching for a sense of security\" appeared frequently among this class of graduates.Wu said that he needs to make money to gain that feeling. Meanwhile, some of his peers chose to take the civil service exam, while others preferred jobs that provide household registration in Beijing. Some simply chose to work for State-owned enterprises or large companies because that made them feel more secure.Wang Hongying, Party secretary of the School of Languages and Communication Studies at Beijing Jiaotong University, said there are big differences between today\'s graduates and those of 10 years ago.According to Wang, today\'s young people are focused more on their feelings than on rational thought when they make choices. For example, they pay more attention to the working environment and company culture, and they have more patience to wait to \"grow up\".\"In the past, we heard that many college graduates overseas were taking gap years, and this phenomenon is becoming more and more popular in China. Some use the break to retake the graduate school entrance exams or go abroad for further study, while others just want to stop and \'wait for themselves\' (to understand their own needs),\" she said.\"The country\'s economic development has given this generation a sense of security,\" she said. The 20 years during which this generation grew up was also the time in which China developed from being relatively well-off to well-off. \"So they grew up with a certain sense of security. This is the confidence that the country\'s development has brought to this generation,\" she said.In China, the school entry age is 6 years old, so children born in the second half of 2000 and the first half of 2001 started school in 2007, went to college in 2019 and graduated this year.\"This generation is regarded as a lucky one because its members grew up in a favorable environment. However, at the same time, it is also an anxious generation, and these young people may face greater employment pressures,\" Wang said.Hou Jianguo (second from right), president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, shakes hands with students during the graduation ceremony at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing on July 1. ZHU XINGXIN/CHINA DAILYGlut of applicantsThose pressures are likely caused by the large number of graduates and also because young Chinese who graduated from schools overseas returned during the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in a glut of applicants on the job market. In recent years, students have felt more employment pressures.\"From society\'s point of view, what we are pursuing is the reduction of occupational disparity: that is, whether it is government units, large or small, State-owned or private enterprises, the differences between them are narrowing. Many developed countries have gone through this phase. We have not been able to achieve development and balance in such a short period of time, so this is the next problem to be solved,\" Wang said.Wu, the graduate in Spanish, said: \"Each generation has its own mission and topic. We need to acknowledge the fact that this generation is approaching its problems calmly. Looking on from a distance and saying that we are relaxed or we are distressed are both excessive generalizations, and I think they are unnecessary.\"I am a big believer in making the best choice for yourself at any given moment.

The story offers a glimpse into the star-studded history of the Tang era, which is often seen as a golden age in Chinese history due to its economic prosperity and cultural achievements.Since its debut on July 8, the movie has generated 267 million yuan (37 million U.S. dollars) in ticket sales during the country\'s bustling summer movie-going season. Continuing its streak of rising revenue, the film grabbed the second spot on the daily box office chart on the fourth day of its release, according to movie data platform Maoyan.The intellectual and artistic achievements of the Tang poets and their works epitomize the pinnacle reached by Chinese civilization, said Xie Junwei and Zou Jing, directors of the film. Therefore their wish was to create a story of the Tang Dynasty, of poetry, and of the poets\' ideals and pursuits.Featuring 48 poems composed in the Tang dynasty, \"Chang An\" presents a panorama of the most excellent poets of that time as well as their political aspirations and ideals of humanity.The film expresses the spirit of Tang Dynasty poets, as embodied by Li Bai and Gao Shi, in pursuing their ideals unfazed by adversities whatsoever. This is not only the theme of the film, but also connects to the inner world and pursuits of contemporary Chinese people, Xie said.According to the production team, portraying epic history through animation not only provides them with greater flexibility in shaping characters and storytelling but also imbues the entire narrative with a heightened sense of romance.For instance, viewers were impressed by the fantastic scenes when poet Li Bai read out one of his most famed works to toast more wine with his friends.\"Li Bai\'s piece is both unshackled from rules and melancholic, which is a blend of various emotions and colorful imagination. It is particularly akin to the expression of animated films, so we can use visual techniques to show the artistic landscape of the poem and follow Li Bai\'s step into his spiritual world,\" Xie said.For many moviegoers, the film is not only a cinematic work or a literary history lesson, but also an echo from the past.Comment of a netizen named Cealar on China\'s leading film rating platform Douban succinctly captures the significance of the film: \"I was touched by the sound of children reciting poems in the theater.

(Xinhua/Wen Lin)Now, 880 villages in the prefecture are developing the tea industry. The sector emerges as a pillar industry for 570 once-impoverished villages to promote rural revitalization by building on the success of poverty alleviation. It fattens the wallets of 830,000 tea growers, whose annual average income from the industry exceeds 7,000 yuan (about $966).Huanglianxi village in Bajiao Dong ethnic township of the prefecture is the birthplace of Enshi Yulu Tea or Jade Dew Tea, a typical example of steamed green teas in China. In October 2022, Enshi Yulu Tea was included in that year\'s programs for nurturing premium agricultural brands by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.Thanks to a remarkable increase in the influence of Enshi Yulu Tea, almost every household in the village now plants tea trees. Home to over 7,000 mu (about 466 hectares) of tea gardens and 19 tea processing plants, the village has become an important base of tea leaves for the tea brand in Enshi. By the end of June this year, income from tea leaves in the village had exceeded 30 million yuan, resulting in an increment in annual per capita income of more than 9,700 yuan.During the tea picking season three months ago, Lan Yuanbin, a 44-year-old resident from Huanglianxi, and his parents could harvest 35 kilograms of fresh tea leaves from his tea gardens and earn a net profit of up to over 6,000 yuan each day. His annual net income from the tea industry exceeds 200,000 yuan.Now, the thriving tea industry has attracted young laborers to return to the village to plant, make and sell tea.However, in the past, Enshi had difficulty selling local tea due to the lack of brand influence, and young laborers worked elsewhere as migrant workers, including Lan Yuanbin.In recent years, Enshi has promoted the green and standardized development of the tea industry and the building of strong brands.With support from the local government, Lan Yuanbin and several others established a tea company in June 2018.\"We adopt a business model that involves the company, cooperatives and households. We provide tea seedlings, relevant materials, and technical guidance for tea growers, and promote the use of organic fertilizers and biopesticides. We refuse to purchase tea leaves that have excessive pesticide residue and fail to meet quality standards,\" said Lan Yuanbin, who is responsible for purchasing fresh tea leaves for the company.He added that the company has strict standards for tea planting and the harvesting of tea leaves.This year, fresh spring tea leaves grown according to the company\'s requirements were sold for up to more than 200 yuan per kilogram, one to two times higher than ordinary ones, said Lan Yuandong, a 56-year-old tea grower in Huanglianxi village. He added that his family\'s net income from selling spring tea leaves surpassed 30,000 yuan since the beginning of this year.At present, there are over 1.8 million mu of tea gardens in Enshi. The prefecture has built a national green food and organic food (tea) raw material standardized production base that covers 778,500 mu, accounting for 43.3 percent of the total area of tea gardens.Yang Shengwei, successor of Enshi Yulu Tea or Jade Dew Tea, processes tea leaves in Enshi, central China\'s Hubei Province, May 18, 2018. (Xinhua/Wen Lin)The flourishing tea industry is inseparable from the revival of the processing techniques of Enshi Yulu Tea, which can be partly attributed to Yang Shengwei, a state-level representative inheritor of the techniques listed as a national intangible cultural heritage. For years, Yang, 86, has visited local tea workshops and senior tea makers for revitalizing the traditional techniques.At the end of 2005, Zhang Wenqi, a businessman from east China\'s Jiangsu Province, registered a tea company in Bajiao Dong ethnic township. He invited over 10 senior tea makers including Yang to pass on the processing techniques of Enshi Yulu Tea, and bought modern machines to replace manual labor in some processes. As a result, the company\'s tea products sold out quickly after they hit the market.In March 2007, Enshi Yulu Tea was recognized as a geographical indication (GI) product, and Zhang\'s company became the first enterprise authorized to use the GI mark on its Enshi Yulu Tea products. Three months later, several departments in Enshi rolled out policies to support tea companies, including offering loans with discounted interest rates.Backed by supportive policies, Zhang poured over 16 million yuan to invite experts from institutes including Huazhong Agricultural University to develop equipment for the processing of Enshi Yulu Tea. In April 2009, Zhang\'s company built the first mechanized production line for the tea in the prefecture.The production line can produce 1,500 kilograms of Enshi Yulu Tea per day and improve processing efficiency by over 50 times compared with manual work, Zhang said.Over the past years, Enshi has invested over 2 billion yuan in supporting the technological upgrading of tea companies. At present, the prefecture is home to 2,484 tea processing companies, including 130 all-electric ones and 95 above designated size.

CHINA DAILYHua Ni, a female panda from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, who currently lives at the Everland Resort in South Korea, gave birth on Friday to a pair of female cubs, the first pair born overseas this year and also the first giant panda twins born in South Korea.In mid-February, when Hua Ni showed signs of coming into estrus, Chinese and South Korean experts immediately set up an online technical guidance team. Under the careful guidance of the Chinese giant panda center experts, Hua Ni and her mate Yuan Xin were able to mate naturally.Hua Ni was found to be pregnant in early June. In order to ensure a smooth birth, the Chinese giant panda center immediately sent experts to South Korea to provide on-site guidance on managing the feeding and care of Hua Ni and her cubs.As a result of the efforts of both sides, Hua Ni gave birth to twins, the first at 4:52 am and the second at 6:39 am on Friday, Seoul time.

(Xinhua/Alfredas Pliadis)A long list of bloody wars and conflicts involving NATO countries suggests the bloc is more than a grave challenge to global peace and stability.RECKLESS EXPANSIONNATO, as both history and relevant theories on military alliance would dictate, is destined to disintegrate once the Cold War ended. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. Far from disbanding, the alliance has been bent on reckless expansion.NATO\'s expansion has become a petri dish of conflicts and chaos. Experts say NATO\'s eastward expansion and the pressure it has been exerting on Russia are to blame for the ongoing Ukraine crisis.Since 1999, the bloc has made six eastward expansions, advancing more than 1,000 km all the way to the Russian border, thereby pushing Russia into a corner.Even after the Ukraine crisis began, NATO has not slowed its pace with Finland officially accepted as its 31st member in April.The national flag of Finland and emblem of NATO are seen at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, April 4, 2023. (Xinhua/Zheng Huansong)\"Sizeable\" is the culpability of the United States and its NATO allies, wrote Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, after the Ukraine crisis broke out.\"Moving an alliance that one great power dominated to the border of another major power is inherently destabilizing and provocative,\" Carpenter observed.Many European countries had opposed NATO\'s reckless expansion out of security concerns, but Washington apparently chose to turn a blind eye to the misgivings from across the Atlantic.\"The Americans wanted us to immediately integrate Ukraine in its entirety into NATO, and it was the French and the Germans who halted the idea, saying, non, beware, it\'s very sensitive for Russia, and it must not be done so fast. Now in effect, we witness the prediction coming true,\" said Pierre Conesa, a former senior official with the French Defense Ministry.CULPRIT OF CONFLICTSThe U.S.-led NATO was the chief culprit of a series of brutal conflicts, putting in grave peril people\'s lives in different parts of the world.\"NATO is not a defense alliance; it is an alliance which wages illegal wars,\" said Sevim Dagdelen, a member of the German Left Party.NATO forces launched 78 days of bombardment against Yugoslavia in 1999, causing over 8,000 civilian casualties and displacing about 1 million.Other countries, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, have also fallen victim to the U.S.-led NATO\'s belligerence and violations of human rights.In the two-decade-long Afghanistan war fought nominally to protect civilians, NATO\'s airstrikes killed thousands of civilians.This photo taken on July 2, 2021 shows the Bagram Airfield that served as a main U.S. and NATO forces base after all U.S. and NATO forces evacuated in Parwan province, eastern Afghanistan. (Xinhua/Sayed Mominzadah)At the same time, the military alliance engages in an aggressive arms race and is thwarting all negotiation efforts related to the Ukraine crisis, Dagdelen added.Despite all the chaos and conflict already inflicted, NATO is spreading its tentacles to the Asia-Pacific region with an express aim of containing China.In recent years, NATO members continuously sent jets and warships for military exercises in China\'s surrounding waters, which heightened tensions in the region.Earlier this year, NATO announced the decision to set up a liaison office in Tokyo in 2024, which has triggered high alert among countries around the world, not least in the Asia-Pacific region.As manifested in the wars outside the alliance area, NATO, under the leadership of the United States, aspires to worldwide influence and global hegemony, Dagdelen said.\"Japan is not located in the North Atlantic either. NATO\'s desire for the Indo-Pacific to be in its zone of influence is part of this fatal expansion policy,\" she said. \"If we picture this conflict as a game of chess, then NATO is looking for pawns that can be sacrificed, if need be, to secure a better position.\"In a statement released by the public policy journal platform Pearls and Irritations on Monday, Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating also slammed NATO\'s continued existence and its attempt to expand into Asia.\"Exporting that malicious poison to Asia would be akin to Asia welcoming the plague upon itself. With all of Asia\'s recent development amid its long and latent poverty, that promise would be compromised by having anything to do with the militarism of Europe -- and militarism egged on by the United States,\" said Keating.Leaders of regional countries like Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also cautioned about the danger of being forced to pick sides in the bloc confrontation being forced upon the region by Washington.MOUNTING CRITICISMGiven its spectacular acts of peace sabotage, the military bloc has been widely criticized for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and undermining regional peace and stability.People attend a parade against NATO in Paris, France, July 8, 2023.

(USTB/Handout via Xinhua)BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Among the eye-catching college admission notices full of fresh ideas, a thin but steel one designed by the University of Science and Technology Beijing (USTB) became the top envy of Chinese netizens.The glossy and almost gauzy admission letter is regarded as one that \"deserves to be treasured for the student\'s whole life\" by many tech-savvy Chinese due to its application of cutting-edge steel rolling techniques.In the mobile communication era of 4G, the thickness required for an ultra-thin low-carbon steel foil is 0.12 mm to enable convenient and speedy signal transmission.Such a demanding requirement is tightened to a mere 0.10 mm in today\'s 5G new era, which means more complicated techniques for its manufacturers.For a long time, the rolling methods relied heavily on foreign enterprises. However, Shougang Group teamed up with the USTB in 2013 to conduct scientific research and development on the continuous rolling process of \"5G steel,\" a nickname of the ultra-thin low-carbon steel foil.According to the experts, 5G steel is used for 5G base station signal receivers, signal transmission filters, and integrated circuit boards.This photo taken on July 2, 2023 shows the college admission notice designed by the University of Science and Technology Beijing(USTB), which was made from \"5G steel,\" in Beijing, capital of China.

Otherwise, the steel will fracture into pieces due to excessive tension fluctuation.To achieve their initial goal, the team endeavored a decade-long effort, effectively shortening the responding time of the controlling system in charge of the steel rolling by two-thirds.Their perseverance paid off immensely, also leading to the delicate college admission notice that went viral online.Though there is a long way ahead to apply the 0.07-mm-thick steel in industrial production, Fang believes that their breakthrough can help facilitate China\'s advance in communication technologies in the future.By the end of May, the number of 5G base stations in China exceeded 2.84 million amid the country\'s efforts to build the world\'s largest and most advanced network infrastructure.

In other words, for every kilogram of weight gained by a broiler, 0.1 kilograms of feed will be reduced, and the breeding cycle will be shortened by three to five days,\" Su said.Second, as a leader in China\'s animal husbandry, New Hope has also brought \"Chinese standards\" to Egypt. The comprehensive technical support and thoughtful services for farmers during the 40-day poultry breeding cycle are crucial to New Hope\'s success in the Egyptian market from a \"new face\" into today\'s \"big brand,\" said Asmaa Saeid, deputy manager of the company\'s technical service department.A chemist works at the lab of Chinese company New Hope Egypt Co., Ltd. in Menoufia province, Egypt, July 6, 2023.

However, the company still has confidence in the Egyptian market.Mohamed Ramadan, deputy manager of the company\'s production department, told Xinhua that during the past year of economic turmoil in Egypt, his department has succeeded to meet market demand. \"Our wages have increased, and our employees are very satisfied,\" he said.Shao Wen, head of the Egypt area of New Hope, acknowledged that the current economic challenges are the most significant faced by the company in over a decade.

Some Western media outlets pointed out how the Japanese side and the IAEA called it \"treated water\" instead of \"nuclear-contaminated water\". A BBC report even inserted a video in which a reporter participated in a \"fish-eating performance\" to say fish caught near Fukushima was \"very safe\" and there was nothing to worry about.Some Western media outlets have tried to be \"objective\" or \"neutral\" by quoting various sources, but they deliberately avoid asking key questions, including what are the environmental hazards of the discharge plan, how independent and representative are the samples obtained by the IAEA, and is Japan\'s assessment of the discharge plan adequate?Multiple studies have shown that the nuclear-contaminated water from the nuclear plant contains more than 60 radionuclides. Even Japan admits that about 70 percent of the treated nuclear-contaminated water does not meet discharge standards.A German marine research institute said the radioactive materials will spread across most of the Pacific within 57 days. The radionuclides will be discharged continuously into the sea for 30 years or more, not only damaging the marine ecological environment but also endangering human health and life.So why are some Western countries so \"calm\" about it? It is because of their own convoluted past. After all, in the 1940s and 50s, the United States conducted 67 nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands. The US also uses nuclear security as a bargaining chip to win over Japan and make it dependent on the US.However, the attitude of Western countries cannot help but make people ask: What kind of hypocrisy and double standard makes one keep an eye on developing countries while being selectively blinded to its allies?

But from the fear of it being able to write university essays to make anyone from journalists to artists obsolete, these mysterious AI chatbots have sprung into public consciousness and triggered mixed responses.NEW FRONTIERSChinese technology companies have begun making their dent in the generative AI space. Some have unveiled large language models, while others are developing industry-specific models covering various fields.Speaking to Xinhua, founder of Westlake Xinchen company, Lan Zhengzhong, said China has been doing some terrific work in basic research, algorithms, and industrial application of AI models, and AI technology is a crucial tool for upgrading industries and boosting productivity.Generative AI is able to support multi-dimensional interaction, integration, and penetration of digital content with other industries to provide new driving forces for various sectors, according to a white book released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology.The use cases of generative AI are already taking flight across industries. Some financial services institutions are testing the technology to help financial advisers better leverage insights from the research reports, while the salesforce has integrated the technology into its customer-relationship-management platform.Tian Qi, chief scientist of Huawei Cloud AI field, said that AI technology has ushered in an explosion after decades of development. \"It has not only changed the way humans interact with machines but also greatly enhanced productivity.\"The value of the generative AI market is set to reach 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars by 2032 from just 40 billion dollars in 2022, according to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence.The compound annual growth rate for the sector over the next ten years could expand by 42 percent, driven first by training infrastructure and then inference devices for large language models, advertising, and other services, the report added.INDUSTRIAL CONCERNSBut the commercial use of generative AI chatbots has triggered concerns, including upending the professional sector, ethics, and leaks that infringe on personal privacy and data security.\"On one hand, generative AI will facilitate the automation and intelligent upgrading of certain job positions, potentially rendering them obsolete, but on the other hand, generative AI will also create new professions,\" said Lan.As for the protection of intellectual property rights, Du Lan, senior vice president of Chinese AI and intelligent speech company iFLYTEKAI, said that a balance should be struck between protecting the rights and interests of originators and encouraging innovation.The Chinese internet regulator published a draft regulation on generative AI in April, covering a wide range of issues that are frequently debated in relation to the governance of generative AI globally, such as data protection, non-discrimination, bias, and the quality of training data.', 'Generative technology data Lan industries intelligent platfo', '2023-07-12', 'By Zhou Qianxian, Gao Jianfei and Zhang Zhaoqing (Xinhua) 08:56, July 12, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- With generative artificial intelligence (Al) becoming the talk of the t', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 09:34:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0712/c90000-20042867.html');

(Xinhua)TIANJIN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- It seems another normal day for 73-year-old Wang. After making coffee at a cafe like a barista, she goes to a grocery store to buy daily necessities and then waits at a bus stop, ready to return home.Wang has a serious cognitive impairment. She has forgotten the names of her children, constantly loses track of time, and does not know that the people she encounters -- from cafe customers to shop assistants -- are her fellow residents at a Chinese rehabilitation facility.This Hetong Cognitive Rehabilitation Center in north China\'s Tianjin has built life-like settings, including a restaurant, a cafe, a cinema, a grocery store and a bus stop, to engage seniors like Wang in social activities, encouraging them to live and work like other citizens. All these elements form an integral part of role-playing rehabilitation therapy provided to senior citizens with cognitive disorders.Chai Dingfang, a social worker at the center, said the role-playing activities can help the elderly retrieve their identities through social interactions, resist further cognitive decline, and improve their physical and mental condition.\"For example, the center\'s unfamiliar environment often triggers a desire in newly arrived elderly individuals to return home. In such situations, I would guide them to the \'bus stop.\' Seeing a familiar bus route at a bus stop would ease their anxiety, and they would wait quietly for the \'bus\' until the nurses pick them up,\" she said.In the restaurant, which is open to participation from people outside the facility, four \"waiters\" walk around elderly-friendly tables and on non-slip mats.A \"waiter\" surnamed Chen, 63, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s Disease. Despite having participated in the exercise before, Chen continued to make mistakes. Her handwriting on orders was illegible, and she couldn\'t remember the numbers of the tables waiting to be served.She was also unable to recognize that one of her customers, Hao Shuang, was her own daughter. Nevertheless, Hao displayed exceptional patience as she received her mother\'s services.\"I\'m glad to see her calmness has been restored in this new job. This is so different to how she used to be -- grumpy, stuck at home and unable to take care of herself because of the disease,\" Hao said.She said the role-playing experience has also been a salvation for her family. \"Seeing my mother bringing the hot dishes to the table, just like she did when I was a child, brings back my most cherished memories of her,\" she said.According to a report released by the China National Committee on Ageing, more than 15 million people in China aged 60 and above have cognitive impairments, and the figure is expected to reach 22.2 million in 2030.But, the good news is that public awareness is also rising. The Tianjin center said it has an increasing number of volunteers, including college students, who offer to dine at the restaurant and chat with the patients serving them.\"Everyone is trying their best to be kind to our \'waiters\' and to immerse them in a warm and loving atmosphere,\" Chai said.In June, the National Health Commission said a nationwide campaign would be launched from 2023 to 2025 to promote the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer\'s, with efforts to raise public awareness of the disease and guide the country\'s elderly population to pay attention to their brain health.Fang Jiake, chairman of the Hetong Public Welfare Pension Group, which runs the rehabilitation facility, said that humanistic care is important at a time when effective medical cures for cognitive disorders remain scarce.\"We hope to use these kinds of activities to help elderly patients rediscover their value of life and live with dignity,\" Fang said.According to Chai, an increasing number of patients are willing to open their hearts and talk with the care workers at the center through the role-playing rehabilitation therapy. She also keeps a record of the daily lives of the elderly patients in writing or on video and sends updates to their families.\"I want to document these good memories before they are erased from their brains,\" Chai said.A senior citizen with cognitive disorder makes coffee like a barista under the guidance of a social worker at Hetong Cognitive Rehabilitation Center in north China\'s Tianjin April 17, 2023.

He delved into topics, such as wetlands, their significance, and the intricate web of life that sustains them.The participants in the study tour were mainly students from Zhizhen Middle School in Hengshui City, Hebei. Through interactive discussions and role-playing activities, students were able to grasp the importance of ecological diversity and the interconnectedness of all living beings.\"This biology class has provided us with a wealth of ecological knowledge, and more importantly, helped us develop an ecological mindset to care for nature, starting from ourselves,\" said Mou Zhijie, a student who was part of the group.The lake has become an important ecological research and learning base for environmental agencies, schools, and various organizations throughout the country. It is recognized not only for its educational value but also as a sanctuary for a wide variety of bird species.Hengshui Lake is a national nature reserve that boasts a complete wetland ecosystem. It is home to 333 bird species, including 21 ones under China\'s top protection.Howes has been a frequenter of the lake. The ornithologist\'s rendezvous with the lake can be traced back to 2015 when the rare Baer\'s Pochard was discovered, marking the beginning of a journey of collaboration and conservation.\"The ecology of Hengshui Lake is unique and holds great research value. I love this place,\" Howes said.Hengshui Lake has become the most important known breeding location for Baer\'s Pochard, a type of diving duck listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The bill, which passed the first out of three rounds of voting in the parliament overnight Monday, aims to prevent the Supreme Court from overturning government decisions on the grounds of \"reasonability.\"In January, the Supreme Court used this standard to cancel the appointment of Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party and a key member in Netanyahu\'s coalition, as a minister because of his conviction for tax fraud in 2022.The bill was widely criticized by legal experts. Avichai Mandelblit, Israel\'s former attorney-general, said in an interview with Channel 12 TV news that Israel \"has come to the threshold of becoming a dictatorial state.\"The protests began in the morning, with rallies held in Tel Aviv, Haifa, Herzliya, Beersheba, Eilat, and other cities.Protesters temporarily blocked the Azrieli Junction, a major crossroads in Tel Aviv, as well as the adjacent Ayalon Highways, Israel\'s main freeway, and Route 1, which connects Tel Aviv and other parts of Israel.On the central Mediterranean beaches of Israel, women lined up to participate in a human chain, calling for democracy and equal gender rights.The police used water cannons on the protesters in several locations. Videos on social networks showed policemen pushing protesters to the ground and punching them.Two photographers with Ha\'aretz newspaper and Yediot Aharonot, two of the country\'s leading daily newspapers, were briefly arrested. One of them was handcuffed and the other beaten, as shown in a video of their arrests.In the afternoon, about 20,000 demonstrators, as estimated by the organizers, gathered at the main entrance of Ben Gurion Airport, Israel\'s main international airport, waving the blue-and-white flags of Israel. The police deployed around 1,000 officers, who in some cases clashed with the demonstrators.The protests continued into the night, with tens of thousands rallying in Tel Aviv and on major roads across the country.According to Channel 13 TV reports, at least 19 demonstrators were injured and required hospital care. By the evening, the police said in a statement that at least 76 protesters had been arrested.Over 400 Air Force reserve soldiers, including pilots, held a meeting to discuss the possibility of joining the other reserve soldiers who already announced their intention to refuse service if the government proceeded with the judicial overhaul.In a public speech on Tuesday night, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called for \"an end to the calls for refusal,\" citing that they \"hurt the military, the security system, and Israel\'s security.\"Netanyahu maintains that reform is needed in order to curb what he calls the \"overly activist\" Supreme Court.The grassroots movement, which includes prominent legal experts, economists, hi-tech entrepreneurs, and former senior security officials, has been holding protests against the judicial overhaul for 27 consecutive weeks.Netanyahu, Israel\'s longest-serving leader, returned to office last December, leading a rightist government coalition consisting of ultranationalist and ultra-religious parties.People take part in a protest against the government\'s plan to overhaul the judiciary in Tel Aviv, Israel, on July 11, 2023.

The location is no coincidence, given Lithuania has been one of its most zealous members, even to the point of destroying its relationship with China. Notably in attendance to the summit was South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, as well as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Their presence of course reflects the direction the United States endeavours to shuffle NATO towards, transcending it beyond what was a regional security organisation, into a global tool for its own hegemonic ends.First founded in 1949, the principal objective of the NATO alliance was to secure a means of collective self-defence in the midst of the emerging Cold War. With the powers of Europe having been considerably weakened by World War II, the organisation allowed them to defend each other as well as receive protection from the United States, which stood as an equilibrium to the equally matched Warsaw Pact led by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR). However, following the end of the Cold War, NATO did not disband itself given that its primary purpose was achieved.Rather, the US began to transition it towards being an ideological organisation which served the demands of US hegemony and therefore, even without a given threat, the alliance began to expand itself and impose its will on smaller targets, such as Serbia, or countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In doing so, repeated NATO expansion into the former Warsaw Pact territories created strategic tension and suspicion with the post-USSR Russian Federation, of which the most decisive impact has been the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict in 2022, a devastating event which has jeopardised the safety, security, and wellbeing of the continent.People take part in a protest against Sweden hosting a large international military exercise and the country striving to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Stockholm, Sweden, on April 22, 2023. (Photo by Patrick Ekstrand/Xinhua)The United States, however, has used this conflict to further NATO’s ends and attempt to impose a “strategic defeat” on Moscow through escalating the situation on the battlefield, and aiming to expand the organisation even further, namely with the admittance of Sweden and Finland, while continuing in lip service to profess a path to membership to Ukraine. In doing so, the US has been able to dramatically expand its influence over Europe in the domain of military and security, and thus it has no intention to try and end the war through peace talks, no matter what the cost may be on Ukraine or other countries in Europe.In maintaining this context of strategic confrontation, public aspirations have been made to expand the presence of NATO beyond the North Atlantic, and to make it an active participant in East Asia with the goal of targeting and containing China. Hence, the leaders of Japan and South Korea are also present. Tokyo likewise hopes that NATO will establish an “office” in the country. As it is, the United States is dramatically attempting to accelerate its military presence and alliances in the system. It has created new formats, such as AUKUS, while also expanding access to military bases in the Philippines, Papua New Guinea and in addition, planning to deploy a nuclear submarine in South Korea. It thus aims to “multilaterialize” all of these groups to create a comprehensive alliance targeting Beijing, all in the name of preserving hegemony in Asia.The import of NATO into East Asia will be disastrous for all countries involved from a security perspective. First, it objectively threatens the neutrality of ASEAN states. Secondly, it revives historical memories of European “gunboat” diplomacy, whereby military power was used to impose the will of western powers on Asia states, such as China and others. Thirdly, it threatens decades of stability, shared growth, integration and prosperity in Asia in the name of creating a US led ideological bloc, which like in Europe, seeks to divide so that it can dominate and entrench its own interests.As such, many countries in Europe have growing reservations about the direction the Ukraine conflict is heading in, including the level of military support to the country, as well as the economic toll they have experienced in terms of energy prices and inflation. Last month, the Eurozone entered recession. The continued strengthening of NATO and the escalation of the conflict is a challenge to the independence and strategic autonomy of Europe. Therefore, although the US often demands the image of conformity and unity in such summits, especially in pushing its vision for Ukraine, the reality is far from it. Thus, countries should be wary of exporting this model into the Asia-Pacific, which will not bring peace and security, but the opposite.Tom Fowdy is a British analyst of politics and international relations with a primary focus on East Asia.The opinions expressed in this article reflect those of the author, and not necessarily those of People\'s Daily Online.', 'nato', '2023-07-13', 'By Tom Fowdy (People\'s Daily Online) 09:18, July 13, 2023', 'Participants pose for a photo during the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, July 11, 2023.

(Xinhua/Lin Shanchuan)During a livestream show for vinegar products of Yiyuanqing, a time-honored brand of vinegar in Taiyuan, the company\'s livestream host showed viewers big vats where vinegar is made, and featured the packing workshop and other facilities of the factory where vinegar products are made.\"It\'s certainly more effective to show the production techniques on site than simply telling viewers how the products are made. Livestream shows in factories can help consumers better understand the products and increase customer stickiness. They also attract new customers for us,\" said Guo Li, an executive in charge of livestream shows at the company.The company also livestreams the real-life scenarios of workers packing and loading vinegar products onto express delivery vehicles, Guo said.\"The scene of rows of express delivery vehicles parked outside our warehouse amazes viewers. Many of them make comments when they see such a scene, which can also improve the popularity of our livestream shows,\" Guo said.According to Guo, the company holds livestream shows in factories during each of the major online shopping sprees in China, such as the Singles\' Day shopping festival on Nov. 11, and the \"618\" shopping festival on June 18.Livestream shows in factories during such events can lead to an increase of about 40 percent in the average number of viewers and yield great fruits, Guo noted.Besides vinegar products in Taiyuan, Shanxi, beef balls from the Chaoshan region in south China\'s Guangdong Province have also captured the taste buds of more consumers because of livestream shows that vividly display the production process of the signature food of the Chaoshan region.After joining e-commerce platforms and promoting sales through livestreams, Shantou Chaoting Foods Co., Ltd., a company specializing in beef balls, has seen its beef balls become a very popular type of precooked food.The company, which is based in Shantou city, Guangdong Province, started to sell beef balls on China\'s e-commerce platform Pingduoduo at the end of July 2022. After joining a 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) subsidy campaign launched by the platform, it\'s monthly sales exceeded 1.5 million yuan, and its target of 100,000 yuan daily sales was also attained during a major online promotion event.The company began to hold livestream shows in the factory since it set up an e-commerce department, according to Chen Jiayu, general manager of the company, who disclosed that the number of members of the company\'s e-commerce team has increased from four to more than 70 in recent years.Through the livestream shows held by the company, netizens can see how beef balls are produced step by step.Livestream shows from the factory have many benefits, Chen pointed out. On the one hand, such shows can introduce products and services to consumers in an all-round manner, which helps bring consumers and enterprises closer to each other and enhance consumers\' trust in enterprises; on the other hand, they facilitate the interaction between consumers and enterprises, thus increasing customer loyalty to relevant businesses, he explained.Thanks to its endeavors to employ e-commerce and livestreams, the company has increased its annual sales from around 7 million yuan to more than 55 million yuan in three years.Many other products are embracing broader opportunities brought about by livestream shows in factories.A machinery company in Jinan city, east China\'s Shandong Province, recently sold an industrial laser machine worth 200,000 yuan to a foreign buyer during a livestream show.\"We didn’t expect to sell a machine so easily during a livestream show. This is like taking part in an offline exhibition overseas, when we can directly communicate with the buyers and show them the functions and performance of the products. But the livestream show is much cheaper, as we don\'t have to bear the costs of taking part in exhibitions overseas,\" said Zhang Jie, general manager of the company.In addition to promoting products, livestream shows in factories have also proven effective in helping with recruitment.While watching livestream shows for recruitment, many viewers ask such questions as \"Can you show us the factory premises?\" \"What is the monthly salary for operators?\" and \"Are there any educational prerequisites for mechanics?\"Livestream hosts can quickly answer these questions and directly respond to their requests while hosting livestream shows in factories. After a virtual tour of such facilities as workshops, canteens, and dormitories, job seekers can have a better understanding of the companies and duties of the jobs they intend to apply for.\"We have taken part in livestream shows in studios for recruitment before. But I think the ones that introduce companies directly from inside the companies are more effective, since they can help job seekers get a more comprehensive understanding of the companies,\" said Lu Fang, head of the human resources department of a company headquartered in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, central China\'s Hubei Province.Recruitment-themed livestream shows in factories can brief job seekers better before they submit their resumes, and enable employers to recruit more talent, Lu noted.Such shows are well-received by job seekers, as they effectively reduce the cost of job hunts by offering immersive virtual tours of the workplaces.\"I used to spend a lot of money during job hunts in the past, only to find it all in vain. In addition to the expenses for transportation, food, and accommodations, the trips themselves were often time-consuming. The results were not always favorable and it was difficult to know the actual conditions of the employers,\" a job seeker told People\'s Daily Overseas Edition.\"Livestream shows in factories for recruitment help us get a preliminary understanding of the factories by showing the workplaces and the duties of the jobs, which enables us to make informed decisions,\" the job seeker added.', 'livestream', '2023-07-13', ' (People\'s Daily Online) 16:28, July 13, 2023', 'Instead of simply introducing products in front of a background plate, more and more livestream host', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0713/c98649-20043956.html');

(Xinhua/Xin Mengchen)BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- China has accelerated efforts to comprehensively deepen reforms in its latest move by approving a wide range of proposals, including new systems for a higher-standard open economy, experts noted.A meeting of the Central Commission for Comprehensively Deepening Reform (CCCDR) was held on Tuesday. During the meeting, it was stressed that efforts must be made to put in place new systems for a higher-standard open economy and to promote the gradual transition from dual control over the quantity and intensity of energy consumption to dual control over the quantity and intensity of carbon emissions.Xiong Yuan, chief economist at Guosheng Securities, said in a research report jointly published with his colleague Zhu Hui on Wednesday that the CCCDR meeting mainly focused on reform, and its importance cannot be overstressed.Xiong\'s remarks are not unfounded given that the meeting on Tuesday highlighted the importance of institutional opening up and deepening institutional reform in investment, trade, finance, and innovation, among other key areas of foreign exchanges and cooperation, to actively raise China\'s opening up to a new level.The new systems for a higher-standard open economy are a strategic move that will proactively boost reform and development through opening up.On April 21 this year, when the first meeting of the CCCDR was held, it was already made clear that this year marks the first year of the full implementation of the guiding principles of the 20th Communist Party of China National Congress.Tuesday\'s meeting is the second meeting of the CCCDR. Xiong said that the focuses of the second meeting are all critical areas of the current institutional reform, including new systems for a higher-standard open economy, rural reform, and power system reform.The meeting agreed that while staying focused on the strategic target of realizing the modernization of agriculture and rural areas and building up its strength in agriculture, China should regard the handling of the relationship between farmers and land as its main task. And it should also work faster to shore up weak links in agricultural and rural development, so as to lay a solid foundation for building a modern socialist country in all respects.Since the building of ecological civilization has entered a critical period where cutting carbon emissions has become a strategic focus, the meeting called for efforts to exercise better control over the quantity and intensity of energy consumption and gradually shift towards controlling both the quantity and intensity of carbon emissions.The meeting also agreed that China should actively and prudently promote the institutional reform of the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industries and ensure a stable and reliable supply. The building of a new power system that is clean and low-carbon, safe and sufficient, and cost-effective and highly efficient should also be accelerated to promote the revolution of energy production and consumption and ensure national energy security, according to the meeting.According to Xiong, these proposals highlighted \"thinking under extreme conditions and bottom line thinking,\" and the main line of security runs through it, including national security, energy security, food security, power security as well as science and technology security.Tuesday\'s meeting stressed further unleashing innovation vitality and creativity in institutions of higher learning and research institutes.It also noted that China\'s development is facing a complex international situation. Efforts should be made to optimize the top-level design of new systems for an open economy, deepen institutional reform in trade and investment sectors, expand market access, and optimize the business environment and the service and support system.Xiong said he expected that institutional reforms to be carried out throughout the year.', 'energy security Reform institutional quantity efforts carbon', '2023-07-14', ' (Xinhua) 08:15, July 14, 2023', 'Tourists visit the Bund in east China\'s Shanghai on April 30, 2023.

(Matt McClain/Pool via Xinhua)The similar tone of both sides\' evaluations reflects their shared emphasis on strengthening such communication and their common need to improve China-U.S. relations.BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently concluded her visit to China, summarizing conversations during the four-day trip as \"direct, substantive, and productive.\" The Chinese side also described the interaction as \"candid, pragmatic, in-depth, and constructive.\"The similar tone of both sides\' evaluations reflects their shared emphasis on strengthening such communication and their common need to improve China-U.S. relations.Overall, as recognized by both sides, this round of interaction has injected positive elements for stabilizing China-U.S. relations because it characterizes three keys to improving bilateral ties.The first key is to deepen communication.During her visit, Yellen expressed the willingness to implement the understandings reached by the two heads of state in Bali last year and strengthen communication between the two sides. As for China, it has always shown utmost sincerity in resolving differences with the United States through dialogue.However, since the meeting between the two heads of state in Bali, the United States had not shown any restraint in smearing and suppressing China, severely poisoning the atmosphere for dialogue, and compelling the delay of the interactive agenda set by the two heads of state.As Yellen said at a press conference before concluding her visit, the bilateral meetings during the visit, which totaled about 10 hours, \"served as a step forward in our effort to put the U.S.-China relationship on surer footing.\"Given the current state of China-U.S. relations, restarting communication is not an easy task, but what matters most is to sustain it based on mutual sincerity.The United States should know that communication is not a one-time deal: it requires creating a favorable atmosphere beforehand, building consensus during the process, and solidly implementing them afterward.This photo taken on Aug. 16, 2022 shows the White House in Washington, D.C., the United States. (Xinhua/Liu Jie)To achieve more effective and meaningful interactions, the U.S. side should actively follow up on each dialogue and earnestly implement the consensus and outcomes reached during the discussions.The second key is to address mutual concerns.The aim of establishing communication channels is to facilitate a clear and smooth expression of major concerns and basic positions by both sides.In recent years, the United States has imposed a string of economic sanctions and measures against China, which have undermined the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese market entities and eroded the popular support for bilateral relations.During meetings with Yellen, the Chinese side reiterated its concerns regarding issues such as the removal of tariffs on China, cessation of suppression against Chinese companies, fair treatment of bilateral investments, relaxation of export controls on China, and lifting the ban on products related to China\'s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.In response, Yellen said that the United States is willing to listen to China\'s concerns, does not seek to decouple from China, and has no intention of hindering China\'s modernization process.In the current lowest point of China-U.S. relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties, this kind of constructive interaction is conducive to stabilizing and reversing the downward spiral in the bilateral relationship.The third key is to seek consensus.As the world\'s largest developing and developed economies, China and the United States have built their economic relationship over several decades.Strengthening cooperation is a pragmatic necessity and the right choice for both nations. Through open and sincere communication, the two sides should seek consensus on important economic issues, injecting stability and positive energy into their economic relationship.A container ship of China\'s COSCO Shipping docks at a container terminal of the Port of Long Beach in California, the United States, Aug. 20, 2021. (Xinhua/Gao Shan)Currently, global challenges such as macroeconomic and financial destabilization, climate change, and debt issues are escalating. Effective responses to these global challenges require coordination and cooperation between China and the United States, which aligns with their common interests.Yellen said during the visit that the United States does not seek to decouple from China as it would be disastrous for both countries and create instability globally, and it has no intention to force countries to take sides.\"The world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive,\" Yellen said at the end of her visit.This round of interaction between the two countries brings positive expectations for bilateral relations. However, it is necessary to be wary of the United States\' habitual double-talk on issues concerning China.Just as Yellen visited China, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. government is preparing an executive order to restrict American investments in China, suggesting that the next test for the bilateral relationship may come soon.Regardless of whether the United States is playing a double game or not, China never places its destiny in the hands of other countries, and remains focused on its own development.

(Xinhua/Chen Zhonghao)The Seine River, the second largest river in France, meanders through the heart of Paris. Flowing from west to east, it divides the city into the iconic \"Left Bank\" and \"Right Bank\". The Left Bank is defined by an artistic ambiance, adorned with cafes, theaters, and bookstores, creating a haven for the literary circle and a cultural paradise. On the other hand, the Right Bank houses prestigious landmarks such as the Louvre, the former royal palace, and the Elysee Palace, the current presidential residence, establishing itself as the political center of Paris.Beijing\'s Liangma River used to be a place where caravans would cleanse and refresh their horses before entering the city. Originating from the moat of Beijing, it flows from west to east, eventually merging into the Ba River. The Liangma River traverses diverse areas, including foreign embassies, international hotels, department stores, and trendy commercial streets, connecting various international business districts in Beijing. In 2019, the city\'s Chaoyang District embarked on a waterfront project along the Liangma River. After two years of development and environmental improvements, the Liangma River has transformed from a mere waterway into a captivating aquatic landscape, which consists of \"one river, two lakes, 24 bridges, and 18 scenic spots\". It has now become a must-visit destination in Beijing.During scorching summer days, the riverbanks in cities often serve as the perfect urban \"living room\".

(Photo from the official account of the Chinese Embassy in South Korea on WeChat)Giant panda Ai Bao, leased by China to South Korea, gave birth to a pair of baby pandas on July 7. They are the first pair of giant panda cubs born overseas this year, as well as the first panda twins ever born in South Korea.People all over the world love giant pandas. The animal traces back to the ancestral panda genus Ailurarctos 8 to 9 million years ago and was recorded by many ancient Chinese books. It has been considered a valuable animal since ancient times because of the legends about it and its scarcity.Ai Bao arrived in South Korea in March 2016 on a 15-year lease and joint international research. As a matter of fact, sending giant pandas overseas is not an exclusive practice of modern China. Two pandas were sent to Japan\'s Emperor Tenmu by Wu Zetian, China\'s only empress in the early Tang Dynasty (618-907).Since the founding of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949, giant pandas have officially \"assumed office\" as \"diplomatic envoys\" and were sent to the Soviet Union and North Korea as national gifts.When then U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, the Chinese government gave the United States two pandas, Xing Xing and Ling Ling, as gifts. About 20,000 people came out for the panda pair\'s first day of public viewing in the United States.Out of the consideration of panda protection and propagation, China stopped sending giant pandas as gifts to foreign countries since the 1980s and instead continued its panda diplomacy through research cooperation.According to statistics, China has carried out panda conservation and research cooperation projects with 22 zoos in 17 countries. As of 2022, there were 64 giant pandas and their cubs living outside China.Giant pandas are playing at the Shenshuping giant panda base in Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China\'s Sichuan province. (People\'s Daily Online/Chen Xianlin)Giant pandas have become an important signature of Chinese diplomacy and friendship. Every panda going or living abroad has its interesting stories. For instance, the Japan-born giant panda Xiang Xiang got its name from more than 300,000 suggestions from the public; the Berlin Zoo invited 12 tenors to sing \"Happy Birthday To You\" to celebrate giant panda Jiao Qing\'s birthday; Ouwehands Zoo in the Netherlands has built a special \"Pandasia\" for giant pandas Wu Wen and Xing Ya that covers more than 9,000 square meters; Australia\'s Adelaide Zoo grows 15 species of bamboos so as to provide fresh bamboos to giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni.Currently, giant panda images are more and more appearing in major events, from the 1990 Asian Games panda mascot Pan Pan, to Jingjing, one of the mascots of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Besides, the China International Import Expo, the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games and the Chengdu 2021 FISU Summer World University Games also used panda as their mascots. Panda has been on the logo of the World Wide Fund for Nature since the organization was established.China places extremely high importance on wild life conservation. Giant pandas, which are rare and distributed in a narrow range, are under key protection in the country.Since the 1970s, China has launched a series of major projects of panda protection aiming at conserving the animal\'s habitats, establishing panda reserves and strengthening artificial propagation of pandas. Many universities, under the support and guidance of the Chinese government, started panda-related surveys, protection and research on captive breeding technologies.Thanks to these efforts, giant pandas were downgraded from \"critically endangered\" to \"vulnerable\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species in 2016.In October 2021, the Giant Panda National Park was officially set up. Stretching through Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the national park is of vital significance for protecting rare species, stabilizing giant pandas\' propagation, promoting biodiversity conservation and improving human-nature harmony.Giant pandas have been representing harmony, friendship and inclusiveness since the ancient times.

In Zhouwo village, elements of music can be found everywhere.A worker assembles a saxophone at a factory of the Jinyin Group in Wuqiang county, Hengshui city, north China\'s Hebei province. (Photo/Su Xiaoli)\"Our small village has become a town of music filled with artistic atmosphere,\" said Zhou Zhixue, head of the villagers\' committee of Zhouwo. Zhou said that one third of the village\'s residents work in musical instrument factories.How has the small village been able to build a music town?In the 1980s, there was a surging demand for Western musical instruments in China. Chen Xuekong, a villager in Zhouwo, spotted business opportunities in the market. With musical instrument manufacturing techniques he had learnt in another place, Chen went back to Wuqiang and opened the county\'s first musical instrument factory in cooperation with the villagers.By learning techniques from technicians of musical instrument factories in big cities, the local villagers had continuously improved the quality of products they made.The musical instrument factory later developed into the Jinyin Group, becoming a manufacturer of medium- and high-end products and gradually entering the global market.The Jinyin Group produces more than 100 types of musical instruments, including woodwind instruments, brass instruments, the violin family and the guitar family.The company\'s annual output of Western wind instruments has hit one million, achieving an annual output value of 426 million yuan (about $59.25 million).The musical instrument industry has created employment for local villagers and increased their incomes. However, the \"soft power\" of the village remained the same.Therefore, the local government decided to expand the industrial chain and incorporate music into people\'s lives by building a music town that would produce musical instruments and provide travel experience for tourists.Photo shows a musical instrument museum located in the Zhouwo music town, Wuqiang county, Hengshui city, north China\'s Hebei province. (Photo/Zhao Hongchao)The local government upgraded and renovated infrastructure and invited a culture and tourism company to make an overall renovation plan for the village.While retaining the original appearance of residential houses in the village, the company renovated the residential dwellings and added an artistic touch to them. In 2012, the Zhouwo Music Town was preliminarily completed.The music town has over 80 courtyards that are designed into B&B hotels, coffeehouses, and musical instrument experience stores. A music experience center and a musical instrument museum, which are newly built, are open to college students and teachers, industry insiders and film and television production companies from home and abroad.In July 2022, the Zhouwo Music Town was rated as a national 4A scenic area in China.In recent years, the music town has stepped up efforts to promote itself online and offline, having held many cultural exchange events, including the China Guitar Festival and open-air concerts, which saw the participation of many nationally and internationally renowned musicians, singers and bands.In addition to watching performances, tourists can also go on a tour in the music town, see how musical instruments are made, and buy musical instruments.At a musical instrument experience store, Han Qiang, a salesperson, showed a guitar to tourists and played it, winning their applause.Before turning 40, Han was a farmer. \"I planted crops on about 0.5 hectares of land and occasionally worked at construction sites,\" said Han.Han cultivated an interest in the guitar when he was a construction worker working for the renovation project of Zhouwo village. He became a salesperson and a guitarist at a guitar store in the music town after he turned 40.Photo shows a violin studio in the Zhouwo music town, Wuqiang county, Hengshui city, north China\'s Hebei province. (Photo/Su Xiaoli)\"Sometimes I can sell three to four guitars and violins a day and earn 70,000 yuan (about $9,736) a year,\" said Han.Today, Zhouwo village has become a distinctive music town that integrates musical instrument production, sightseeing, experience and teaching activities, art performances and catering and accommodation. The village\'s music, cultural and tourism industries see burgeoning growth.The annual per capita income of residents in Zhouwo village has increased to 25,000 yuan today from more than 3,000 yuan before the music town was built. The music town has driven the development of six nearby villages.Enterprises related to musical instrument manufacturing have also developed in Wuqiang, helping the county become an important exporter of musical instruments in China.Currently, there are a total of 63 musical instrument manufacturing enterprises in Wuqiang and they have achieved collective and large-scale development. More than 10,000 people in the county are engaged in musical instrument manufacturing. In 2022, the operating revenue of the musical instrument industry in Wuqiang county exceeded 1.91 billion yuan.The many musical events held in Wuqiang have enabled the seeds of music to start to take root in the hearts of local people. The music town has provided public welfare courses for local residents many times, inviting professional music teachers to teach the villagers to play musical instruments on a regular basis. The musical instruments were provided by local enterprises.On a summer night, many bands consisting of local residents performed at a square in the village, winning rounds of cheers from the audiences. A band called \"The Old Boy,\" comprised of Han and several other villagers, also joined the performance.\"I get different feelings when I listen to music and my life has been enriched by music,\" said Zhou Jinxiang, a saxophone enthusiast.The local government in Wuqiang has launched a project of introducing musical instruments at middle schools, primary schools and kindergartens in the county. It has provided more than 1,200 musical instruments for local schools, trained more than 140 full-time and part-time music teachers, and carried out the pilot project in 15 schools.

(Photo courtesy of the FAST)China\'s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) recently found key evidence for the existence of nanohertz gravitational waves.The research was conducted by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration, which comprises researchers from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) and other institutes. Their findings were published online in the academic journal Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA) on June 29.The finding indicates China\'s leading position in the world in terms of the studies on nanohertz gravitational waves.According to Albert Einstein\'s theory of general relativity, space-time is curved. Acceleration of massive objects disturbs the surrounding space-time and produces \"ripples\" which are known as gravitational waves.Li Kejia, a researcher with the NAOC, told People\'s Daily that the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves helps astronomers better understand the origins of the universe.The signals of gravitational waves are extremely weak, but they offer a direct method for probing masses that do not emit light. Therefore, astronomers have long aimed to detect and use gravitational waves to aid in the observation of the universe.Objects of greater mass produce gravitational waves of lower frequency. \"For example, the most massive celestial body in the universe, the supermassive black hole binaries in the center of galaxies, mainly generate gravitational waves in the nanohertz band,\" said Li.Using nanohertz gravitational waves in cosmic observation is thus hugely important in studying key problems in contemporary astrophysics such as supermassive black holes, the history of galaxy mergers, and the formation of large-scale structures in the universe. Global physicists and astronomers have been racing to detect nanohertz gravitational waves.Taking advantage of FAST\'s high sensitivity, the CPTA research team found key evidence for quadrupole correlation signatures compatible with the prediction of nanohertz gravitational waves at a 4.6-sigma statistical confidence level. (Image by CAS New Media Lab)Xu Heng, associate researcher with the NAOC noted that the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves can be very challenging due to their extremely low frequency, where the corresponding period can be as long as several years and wavelengths up to several light-years.\"Using FAST-like large radio telescopes to conduct long-term timing observation of millisecond pulsars with extreme rotational stability is the only known method for effectively detecting nanohertz gravitational waves,\" he added.Regional pulsar timing array collaborations, including the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves, the European Pulsar Timing Array and the Australian Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, have been collecting pulsar timing data for more than 20 years, with the aim of detecting nanohertz gravitational waves.Taking advantage of FAST\'s high sensitivity, the CPTA research team monitored 57 millisecond pulsars, which formed a Galactic-scale gravitational wave detector sensitive to nanohertz gravitational waves. They found key evidence for quadrupole correlation signatures compatible with the prediction of nanohertz gravitational waves at a 4.6-sigma statistical confidence level (with a false alarm probability of two in a million).The team used independently developed data analysis software and data processing algorithms to achieve its breakthrough at the same time as other international groups. Independent data processing pipelines produced compatible results.Luis C. Ho, Chair Professor of Peking University noted that it was a scientific prediction that the mergers of supermassive blackholes produce nanohertz gravitational waves, and this long-anticipated prediction has finally been proved by the CPTA research team.Ho called the finding an important scientific breakthrough that carries lasting and huge significance. It not only has profound impacts on the study of galaxy evolution and supermassive blackholes, but also has opened a brand-new window for gravitational-wave astrophysics, he noted.', 'fast', '2023-07-14', 'By Wu Yuehui (People\'s Daily) 12:20, July 14, 2023', 'Photo shows the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) of China.

It was identified as the tiger that was rescued in April 2021 and then was released in the wild on May 18, 2021, in the area.Apart from the tiger, two infrared cameras also captured the footage of two Amur leopards, a large one and a small one, shuttling through the forests, patrolling their territory, and looking for food. The images of other wild animals, such as roe deer and sika deer, have also been captured by cameras in the Muleng forest area.These wild animals choose to settle here, which shows that the food chain in the Muleng forest area is complete, the biodiversity here is rich, and the ecological environment has been effectively restored, according to the staffers at the forest area.Siberian tigers, also known as Amur or Manchurian tigers, are one of the most endangered animals in the world.

(Photo by Tang Ke/Xinhua)It is good to see that the Chinese government, having drawn many lessons from the financial crisis in transatlantic countries triggered by the Lehman Brothers, has adopted an innovation-driven strategy of pursuing high-end, intelligent and green growth.Recently, the Chinese government released economic data for the first five months of 2023, which indicated that China\'s economy as a whole has continued its post-COVID recovery, even though the rebound in April and May was less than expected.There comes the same old cliche: When the data of the Chinese economy are less satisfactory than forecast, concerns about China\'s development prospects arise. This shows how the world\'s second-largest economy matters to all as each of its subtle changes can affect the global economy.However, we have to admit that for some \"experts,\" this is an opportune time to hype up China\'s \"sluggish\" economy and lecture the public about its predictions regarding \"China\'s collapse.\"The best way to relieve a justified concern and refute a false argument is to offer facts and figures.A ROBUST GROWTH MOMENTUM WITH LOW INFLATIONAfter three years of relatively slow growth, China\'s economy has bounced back and continued to gain momentum since the beginning of 2023. Consumption and investment have picked up speed, and employment and prices have remained stable on the whole.In May, total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 12.7 percent year on year, and catering revenue shot up by 35.1 percent, which shows that as life returned to normal in China, consumption once again became the most important driver of the economy. Given China\'s huge population, the potential for consumption shall not be underestimated. Investment, too, is increasing in fixed assets, infrastructure and manufacturing.More importantly, the rise of these two indicators hasn\'t resulted in inflation as it often does in some developed countries. China\'s CPI rose only 0.2 percent year on year, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter.People view books at a bookstore in Xi\'an, northwest China\'s Shaanxi Province, Jan. 24, 2022. (Xinhua/Shao Rui)HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENT BASED ON A SUSTAINABLE MODELOne exaggerated concern is that China lacks new growth drivers and that if the property sector becomes stagnant, the overall economy will be sucked down with it.It is true that indulging in a fake boom created by a real estate bubble is dangerous. So it is good to see that the Chinese government, having drawn many lessons from the financial crisis in transatlantic countries triggered by the Lehman Brothers, has adopted an innovation-driven strategy of pursuing high-end, intelligent and green growth.From January to May, the added value of aircraft, spacecraft and equipment manufacturing grew by 25.9 percent year on year. Information technology, big data and artificial intelligence have been widely used, and the production index of information transmission, software and information technology service industries has increased by 11.3 percent.The green transformation continued to deepen, and the output of new energy vehicles, solar cells and charging piles grew by 37 percent, 53.6 percent and 57.7 percent respectively.This photo taken on June 29, 2023 shows an industrial robot processing auto parts at carmaker ZXAUTO in Rizhao Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone of Rizhao City, east China\'s Shandong Province. (Xinhua/Guo Xulei)RESILIENT FOREIGN TRADEForeign trade, as one of the three driving forces of growth, has been playing its role even during the COVID period. Trade relations between China and its traditional trading partners are solid, and China\'s foreign trade structure is constantly improving.The argument of China being \"punished\" by \"decoupling\" does not stand. On the contrary, it is precisely because of the fact that it is unrealistic to cut off from China that an increasing number of countries have discarded the concept of \"decoupling.\"Let the data speak for themselves: In the first five months of this year, China\'s imports and exports went up by 4.7 percent year on year, and its trade with countries along the Belt and Road expanded by 13.2 percent. China\'s private enterprises accounted for 52.8 percent of the country\'s total imports and exports, an increase of nearly 4 percentage points over the same period last year.This aerial photo taken on May 9, 2023 shows the container terminal at Lianyungang Port, east China\'s Jiangsu Province.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also predicts that China will achieve its growth target of 5.2 percent this year and contribute more than one-third of global growth.The recently convened 14th Annual Meeting of the New Champions of the World Economic Forum (WEF) offered bountiful evidence of the confidence in China from international society.WEF President Borge Brende said that 36 percent of world economic growth this year may come from China\'s contribution, and that there are great expectations for further investment in China.Business people around the world have cast a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy with loads of newly signed contracts and projects. According to a report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, nearly 60 percent of the companies it surveyed plan to increase their R&D spending in China over the next five years.For those who are not sure about China\'s economy, Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a way. \"I encourage everyone to come to China to see for themselves,\" he said.

The lab, committed to pioneering basic research for the country\'s major strategic needs, has scored a series of world-leading achievements in such fields as B5G/6G network and cybersecurity.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, has been concerned about and consistently supported the growth of the country\'s internet sector and information technology.Shortly after assuming the Party\'s top job in late 2012, Xi asserted that humanity had entered a historical stage of the age of the internet, which is a prevailing trend in the world.He spoke of the significant role the internet can play in improving people\'s lives and boosting development.Back then, though the internet sector was thriving in China, prominent bottlenecks persisted.In 2014, Xi convened the first meeting of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs. He personally headed the group that set the direction for the development of the internet sector.Noting that China had the world\'s largest number of internet users, Xi called for boosting the country\'s strength in cyberspace.At the meeting, Xi put forward the goals, which include making the internet infrastructure more accessible, elevating innovation capacity, developing the information economy, and ensuring cybersecurity.In 2018, a national conference on the work of cyberspace affairs, the first of its kind in the history of the CPC and the country, was held in Beijing.At the key meeting, Xi underscored the need of keenly grasping the historic opportunity for information technology development and enhancing the country\'s strength in cyberspace through innovation.GUIDING HIGH-QUALITY DEVELOPMENTUnder Xi\'s guidance, a series of major decisions and measures involving cyber development were introduced and put into practice.Xi stressed strengthening law-based governance of the cyberspace to make it clean.\"It is no easy job. But it must be done no matter how hard it is,\" he said.By adopting a problem-oriented approach and strengthening top-level design, China has put in place a system for integrated cyberspace management, with its online environment continuously improving.Addressing a study session of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee in October 2021, Xi emphasized improving the top-level design and system building of the country\'s digital economic development.Over the past decade, China\'s information infrastructure has continued to accelerate, its momentum of digital economy development has been strong, and new advances have been made in independent innovation of core information technologies.As for cybersecurity, Xi stressed that \"without ensuring cybersecurity, we cannot safeguard national security; without promoting IT application, we cannot realize modernization.\"Guided by a holistic approach to national security, China has comprehensively fastened the line of defense for cyber and digital security and enhanced its system and capacity building for cybersecurity.Delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the second World Internet Conference in December 2015, Xi proposed to jointly build a community with a shared future in cyberspace.\"Cyberspace is the common space of activities for mankind. The future of cyberspace should be in the hands of all countries,\" he said.The vision of jointly building a community with a shared future in cyberspace has been continuously enriched and developed. China\'s insight and proposals on global internet development and governance have been widely recognized by the international community.DELIVERING BENEFITS TO ALLIn February, a surgeon in the eastern Zhejiang Province successfully removed the inflamed gallbladder of a patient residing some 5,000 km away in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.The remarkable feat was made possible through the use of 5G-powered robotic surgery technology.During the 30-minute surgery, a robot at the hospital in the city of Alaer in Xinjiang responded in sync to the instructions made from an operating platform in a top-notched hospital in Zhejiang.This efficient surgery, demonstrating China\'s efforts to coordinate medical resources between coastal and inland regions for more accessible high-quality medical services, also serves as an example of how information technology is transforming the lives of the country\'s 1.4 billion people for the better.So far, China boasts the world\'s largest and technologically advanced network infrastructure with more than 2.05 billion users of Internet of Things smart devices.Meanwhile, the scale of China\'s digital economy surpassed the 50 trillion yuan (around 7 trillion U.S. dollars) landmark threshold in 2022, with \"internet plus\" services available in basically all aspects of everyday life.By the end of 2022, the number of online shoppers in China topped 845 million, while a total of 363 million people had access to internet-based medical services.Driven by information technology innovation and a booming internet sector, new realms of opportunity have emerged for Song Chunjiao, a villager from central China\'s Hunan Province, and millions of other Chinese people.After taking part in several training sessions organized by the local government, Song became a proficient live streamer and sold over 900,000 kg of local fruits, including pomelo and citrus, annually.Running an e-commerce company of her own, Song also teaches other villagers how to sell local products via live stream. \"They used to make ends meet by doing farmwork or odd jobs. Now they\'re skilled in video filming and editing, as well as selling products online, and can make more than 5,000 yuan a month,\" she said.By 2022, more than 100 million job opportunities were created directly or indirectly through the live stream and short video industries.In a recent survey by social media platform Sina Weibo, which polled nearly 10,000 college graduates, over 60 percent of the respondents indicated that they consider emerging online industries, such as livestreaming, as an option for their future careers.\"Now, with cell phones as our new farm tools and live-streaming as new farmwork, the villagers are expecting a more prosperous life,\" Song said. ', 'internet Chinas The sector heights Elevating Focus Cyberspac', '2023-07-15', ' (Xinhua) 09:32, July 15, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Purple Mountain Laboratories based in Nanjing, capital city of east', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0715/c90000-20044627.html');

(Xinhua/Zhang Nan)A rare scene in the past, this is now a common sight at the FAW Jiefang J7 complete-vehicle smart factory in Changchun City, northeast China\'s Jilin Province.The construction of the First Automotive Works, China\'s first automotive manufacturing plant and predecessor of FAW Group Co., Ltd., was launched in Changchun on July 15, 1953, marking the beginning of the nation\'s auto industry.From its first car rolling off the production line to being one of the world\'s top 500 companies, the FAW has become the epitome of China\'s auto industry development.Showing resilience and a strong momentum of rapid development, China\'s auto production and sales have ranked first in the world for 14 consecutive years, and those of new energy vehicles (NEVs) topped the global market for the eighth year in a row.Particularly, China\'s vehicle exports soared to around 1.07 million units in the first quarter of 2023, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, indicating that China had become the world\'s largest auto exporter in the period, outpacing Japan.INTELLIGENT AND DIGITAL EMPOWERMENTBy the end of 2022, the FAW had produced and sold more than 54 million vehicles and achieved an operating revenue of over 7.9 trillion yuan (about 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars), an achievement that 92-year-old Dou Shuxiang, who retired from FAW, had never imagined.When the FAW was first established, the workers used hammers to make doors, roofs, and wheels as they had no relevant information or experience.\"To build a car, we must build the car body first. We had a very tight schedule then and didn\'t even have time for drawing car blueprints or making molds,\" said Dou, recalling the unfavorable conditions.This file photo taken in August, 1958 shows China\'s first high-end passenger car, Hongqi, in Changchun, northeast China\'s Jilin Province. (Xinhua)In 1958, FAW established China\'s iconic car brand Hongqi, meaning \"red flag.\" The brand has been used as the vehicle for parades at national celebrations.FAW\'s success has stimulated the growth of China\'s auto industry. Over the past 70 years, the country\'s auto industry has gone from manual manufacturing to mechanical manufacturing, and now it\'s moving forward to intelligent manufacturing.At FAW\'s final assembly factory, an intelligent digital platform, which can detect problems with equipment connected to it, has reduced labor and improved efficiency.\"It is not only a manufacturing factory but also a digital platform,\" said Xiu Junyi, an executive with Hongqi manufacturing center, adding that through big data technology, every detail in the factory can be \"moved\" to the digital twin factory, which will provide support for R&D and innovation.In recent years, China has been actively promoting digital technologies to empower the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industries, among which the automobile industry has become the epitome.At an automobile final assembly factory of Chinese automaker Geely Auto Group in Guizhou Province, equipment controlled by digital systems provides accurate and orderly assembly of parts prepared in advance.\"With the help of intelligent systems, the parts information needed for automobile assembly will be sent to the corresponding equipment suppliers, and they will prepare the required parts in advance,\" said Yang Mi, director of the assembly factory in the provincial capital Guiyang.Every car that requires final assembly has an identification system to ensure that the parts needed will not be mismatched, thus realizing lean production, according to Yang.Traditional car manufacturers must go through a digital and intelligent transformation, said She Shangfeng, vice president of Hebei-based Great Wall Motor Co., Ltd.REMARKABLE NEV DEVELOPMENTChina, the largest NEV market in the world, has witnessed significant development in recent years, as the number of competitors and sales of NEVs spiked, and consumers shifted their attention to hundreds of models offered in a wide range of prices.This photo taken on July 3, 2023 shows China\'s 20 millionth new energy vehicle (NEV) produced by GAC Aion New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. in Guangzhou, south China\'s Guangdong Province. (Xinhua/Deng Hua)On July 3, China\'s 20 millionth NEV rolled off the production line in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, creating a remarkable milestone for the country\'s NEV sector.With this record, the NEV sector has entered a new stage of large-scale, globalized and high-quality development, and is becoming an important part of China\'s modern industrial system, according to Fu Bingfeng, executive vice-president and secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).As the auto industry is going through a transformation of unprecedented magnitude, traditional automakers are also revving up their NEV production.In the battery development department of the new energy development institute of the FAW, the staff members are stepping up research and development of new battery technologies.The automaker aims to launch 15 Hongqi NEV intelligent products in the next three years and increase its accumulated NEV production and sales to 1.45 million units by 2025.Global automakers are also accelerating expansion efforts for the NEV sector in China. In late May, Volkswagen inked an investment agreement to build an R&D, innovation, and procurement center for fully connected electric cars in Hefei, capital of Anhui Province. The center is expected to be put into operation in early 2024.NEVs are also a highlight of China\'s vehicle exports, with some domestic NEV brands, such as BYD, gaining a foothold in overseas markets.According to data from the CAAM, Chinese auto manufacturers exported 534,000 units of NEVs in the first half of this year, a 1.6-fold increase compared with the same period last year.\"The NEV is the main direction of the transformation, upgrading and green development of the global automobile industry, and is also the strategic choice for the high-quality development of China\'s automobile sector,\" said Xin Guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology.', 'Aion Chinas silicone sedan Province DIGITAL INTELLIGENT GAC ', '2023-07-15', ' (Xinhua) 09:52, July 15, 2023', '* China\'s auto production and sales have ranked first in the world for 14 consecutive years, and tho', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:23', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0715/c90000-20044643.html');

Wang called for taking into account the aspirations and interests of all parties, and taking the path of common security through extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.Wang said the Asia-Pacific region does not need an arms race, cannot engage in bloc confrontation and is not keen to start things anew. It is extremely opposed to the so-called \"Asia-Pacific version of NATO\", he stressed.Second, safeguarding regional rules and promoting universal security.

(Photo from the World Intellectual Property Organization)Over the past five decades, China has grown from a member of the family of world intellectual property rights (IPR) into an important contributor to the global cause of IPR, transforming into one of the world-leading centers for innovation, creation and technology, said Daren Tang, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).Tang made the remarks at a commemorative event marking the 50th anniversary of cooperation between China and the WIPO.He said the WIPO is willing to strengthen its cooperation with China to promote the construction and development of the global IPR ecology.China has become a major country in intellectual property over the past 50 years. In November 1973, a Chinese delegation for the first time attended a WIPO meeting held in Geneva as an observer, and seven years later, China officially became an member country of the organization. In 1994, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) accepted the first international patent filing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). In 2014, the WIPO set its China office in Beijing. In 2019, China became the biggest user of the PCT system. Last year, China joined the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs and handed the ratification paper of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled to the WIPO.Peking opera is performed at a commemorative event marking the 50th anniversary of cooperation between China and the World Intellectual Property Organization held in Geneva. (Photo from the World Intellectual Property Organization)An official with the CNIPA noted that China and the WIPO have constantly deepened their cooperation and achieved fruitful results in the past 50 years. China will further deepen multilateral cooperation under the WIPO framework to make international IPR governance system more just and equitable, the official added.The rapid development of China\'s IPR has offered solid support for the country\'s innovation-driven development strategy and high-quality development over the recent years.In 2021, the added value of China\'s copyright industry exceeded 8 trillion yuan ($1.12 trillion), accounting for 7.41 percent of the country\'s GDP. The ratio of the exports of the Chinese copyright industry to the country\'s total exports has been maintained above 11 percent for consecutive years. Last year, the country recorded over 6.35 million copyright registrations, eight times of the number in 2012.Tang noted that China has ranked 11th on WIPO\'s Global Innovation Index 2022, the top one among all middle-income economies. Last year, the country saw 70,000 international applications filed under the PCT, four times of those in 2012. Besides, Chinese applicants filed the third largest number of international trademark applications using WIPO\'s Madrid System. The number of trademark applications from China under the Madrid System last year doubled that in 2012.Thanks to enhanced IPR protection, traditional Chinese culture and the Chinese culture industry are embracing more prosperous development. More and more Chinese artists are bringing their talents to places outside China.After the opening ceremony of the commemorative event, Chinese artists staged a splendid art performance. In particular, a bian-lian show, or face-changing show, which is an important subgenre of Chinese Sichuan opera, received warm applause from the audience.The awards ceremony of the second edition of the World Intellectual Property Organization Global Awards is held in Geneva on July 11.

(Photo by Zhou Dongchao/People\'s Daily Online)The Yangtze River Delta region in east China, one of the country\'s economic hubs, boasts high economic vitality, high-level opening up and strong innovation capability. It holds nearly 1/3 of China\'s valid patents and a quarter of the country\'s valid registered trademarks.The region enjoys full-chain circulation of intellectual property rights (IPR) factors, which contributes to its high-quality development.So far, the region has nurtured over 1,800 demonstration enterprises with intellectual property advantages, which drive the comprehensive improvement of the region\'s industrial competitiveness. Centering on integrated circuits, biomedicine, artificial intelligence and other key areas, the region established seven industrial IPR operation centers and 24 national-level patent navigation service bases to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies.Last year, the amount of patent pledge financing in the region jumped 72.6 percent year on year to 186.26 billion yuan ($26.05 billion), accounting for nearly half of China\'s total. Besides, the region is also home to 29 national-level IPR protection centers and fast-response IPR service centers, as well as over 400 mediation organizations for IPR disputes.Focusing on improving mechanisms, smoothening the flow of factors, strengthening protection, optimizing services and deepening reforms, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) is promoting the high-quality integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta with IPR improvement, said Liang Xinxin, spokesperson of the CNIPA.The three provinces and Shanghai municipality in the Yangtze River Delta region have established complete cooperation mechanisms and made a lot of explorations in strengthening IPR protection, optimizing the business environment and serving market entities, Liang added.Over recent years, a series of new mechanisms and models related to IPR have been piloted in the region, and achieved positive results.In Jun 2021, China\'s newly amended Patent Law entered into effect, which has added stipulations on a new patent open licensing system. According to the law, after a patentee declares to the patent administrative department to grant an open license and specify the royalty, anyone can exploit the patent in accordance with conditions during the implementation period of the open license.In May 2022, Shanghai took the lead to pilot the open license. \"Open license has built a bridge for universities, research institutions and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to transfer and commercialize their achievements,\" said Rui Wenbiao, head of Shanghai Intellectual Property Administration.According to Rui, 50 enterprises and institutions in Shanghai have opened 240 patents, and 58 of them are free of charge. The city has introduced 610 patents opened by patentees outside of Shanghai, including Tsinghua University. Shanghai Jiao Tong University has reached a 10-million-yuan deal of an open license with an enterprise, Rui said.A minimally invasive surgical robot is exhibited at the 9th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair in east China\'s Shanghai, June 15, 2023. (Photo by Zhou Dongchao/People\'s Daily Online)The mechanism of the patent open license is just a miniature of the institutional innovation made by the Yangtze River Delta in IPR.In April 2023, Hefei of Anhui province issued the first intellectual property securitization for SMEs that feature specialization, refinement, uniqueness and innovation in the region, with a scale of 123.5 million yuan.Zhejiang province, which is adjacent to Anhui, took the lead in undertaking a pilot reform of the data IPR. It has launched China\'s first public deposit platform for data IPR, and issued the country\'s first rule for data IPR protection for open-source communities and first pledge standard on data IPR, so as to make data ownership clearer, better exploit IPR and make proofing of IPR easier, said Gu Wenhai, deputy director of Zhejiang province\'s intellectual property administration.China\'s first national pilot project for the standardization of data IPR also landed in Zhejiang, Gu told People\'s Daily.Boehringer Ingelheim, a German multinational pharmaceutical company, owns patents of its self-developed innovative medicines in its Shanghai office.\"We feel the importance attached by the Chinese government to IPR protection and to maintaining fair market competition,\" said an executive of the company.As the number of patents owned by foreign enterprises in China keeps growing, IPR is contributing significantly to the high-level opening up of the country.In the Yangtze River Delta region, Shanghai has launched a special campaign for the protection of foreign companies\' IPR for three years in a row, during which over 60 IPR disputes and infringement cases were handled.Shanghai, in collaboration with intellectual property departments from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, has carried out regular dialogues and exchanges for foreign enterprises to understand their demands for IPR protection, and inform them of IPR laws, regulations, services and measures.To assist China\'s high-level opening up, the CNIPA launched pilot programs aiming at establishing permanent representative offices of foreign patent agencies in IPR service clusters, including the Suzhou New District and the Jiangning district of Nanjing, Jiangsu province, building them into international hubs of IPR services,\" said Liang.', 'IPR', '2023-07-15', 'By Gu Yekai () 11:15, July 15, 2023', 'People visit the 9th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair in east China\'s Shanghai, June', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0715/c90000-20044747.html');

The EU is willing to maintain a strong engagement with China and develop a constructive, stable and long-term relationship.On the Taiwan question, Borrell said that the EU is firmly committed to the one-China policy, the core connotation of which is there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is not a country. The EU has never supported \"Taiwan independence\".China plays a key role in global affairs and its global initiatives are widely welcomed. The EU is willing to explore ways to strengthen policy synergy between both sides and promote practical cooperation to achieve more results, said Borrell.The global production and supply chain is intertwined, so it is unrealistic and impossible for Europe and China to \"decouple\". The EU does not support confrontation of camps and parallel systems and the EU has no intention of hindering China\'s development, he said.In response, Wang stressed that China is committed to building an open economy at a higher level and will continue to share its mega market opportunities with the world.China supports the EU in pursuing strategic independence and making independent judgments, he said, adding that China is ready to work with the EU to leverage complementary advantages and dovetail each other\'s global initiatives, including the Belt and Road Initiative and EU\'s Global Gateway strategy.Both sides should jointly safeguard globalization and free trade system by adopting an open and inclusive approach, while opposing protectionism and unilateral bullying, Wang said.Wang called on the two sides to guard against the politicization and instrumentalization of economic issues and the use of \"derisking\" as another term for \"decoupling\".The two senior diplomats also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue.

However, his stay in the infamous camp was a nightmare for Ghalib.Ghalib and other inmates at Guantanamo reportedly suffered indefinite custody and years of abuse at the hands of the U.S. government. In June, Fionnuala Ni Aolain, a United Nations (UN) special rapporteur, visited the camp and told the press about the \"ongoing cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\" to which the detainees were subjected.The Guantanamo detention camp is just one of the many \"black sites\" set up by the United States around the world to hold alleged \"terrorists.\" Throughout the years, the country has furtively established detention camps in at least 54 countries and regions, using them as interrogation facilities for \"terrorist suspects\" while attempting to evade jurisdiction and legal challenges.ARBITRARY ARRESTSGhalib recalled the chaos and panic on the morning of Feb. 26, 2003, when he, serving as a police officer in Afghanistan\'s Nangarhar province then, was violently captured by the U.S. forces.\"I finished my morning prayer and had not yet eaten breakfast ... Then I found myself surrounded by U.S. planes, helicopters and tanks,\" the 59-year-old Afghan told Xinhua.After physically assaulting him, the American soldiers apprehended him and forcibly transported him to U.S. overseas detention camps.A document of the U.S. Department of Defense in January 2005 claimed his innocence and denied his affiliation with al-Qaida or the Afghan Taliban. However, he was kept in custody for the subsequent two years.Upon his return to Afghanistan in 2007, he had to deal with another devastating blow -- the loss of his family members.Similar tragedies befell other detainees. Of the approximately 780 individuals held at Guantanamo, fewer than 20 were put on trial, while a significant number of others endured prolonged detention and abuse without access to a formal trial or any form of compensation.But their lives were permanently altered.One such case was Mohammed Sanghir, a Pakistani who was arrested by the U.S. army while travelling in Afghanistan in 2001.Following a long period of detention at Guantanamo, the man was eventually repatriated due to a lack of evidence linking him to terrorist activities.Nonetheless, the consequences were irreversible. \"Prior to my arrest, I owned a woodworking shop with prosperous business. After I was arrested, my family faced immense hardships and had to sell our property just to make ends meet,\" Sanghir told Xinhua.Equally heartbreaking was the story of young Iraqi Alaa Karim Ahmed. Twenty years ago, Ahmed was on his way to the first day of university with family members. As Ahmed pulled over the car to pick up items fallen to the ground, a nearby group of U.S. troops were struck by an explosion.Despite the absence of evidence linking him to the explosion, the young man, still dressed in his school uniform, was taken away by U.S. soldiers.Following multiple transfers between prisons, Ahmed was finally freed after two and a half years. The scars etched on his skin and flesh, resulting from the prolonged wearing of handcuffs and shackles, serve as a constant reminder of his suffering.CRUEL TORTUREFollowing baseless arrests, every detainee suffered severe mistreatment while being interrogated.At the basement of Jalalabad Airport in the capital of Nangarhar, the U.S. military tied up Ghalib\'s hands and repeatedly plunged his head into water.A few days later, he was transferred to the Bagram prison situated about 40 km north of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.The Bagram prison was nicknamed \"Afghanistan\'s Guantanamo\" due to numerous instances of prisoner abuse. Within one week in December 2002, two detainees lost their lives as a result of abuse by the U.S. military at the camp.A few months later, Ghalib was sent to the Guantanamo detention camp. Upon arrival, he was forcibly undressed, followed by being washed by water pipes and having his head shaved.All inmates, without exception, had to undergo excruciating torture.\"In the first one-and-a-half months, they wouldn\'t let us speak to anyone, wouldn\'t let us call for prayers or pray in the room. I tried to pray and four or five commandos came and they beat me up. If someone would try to make a call for prayer they would beat him up and gag him,\" one of the inmates was quoted as saying by the Guardian.Waterboarding, one of the most brutal interrogation techniques devised by U.S. intelligence officials, was regularly employed.In practice, the victim is immobilized on an inclined board, head and feet raised, and the face covered with a cloth. Water is poured over the cloth, making it hard for the victim to breathe and potentially causing suffocation.Those subjected to waterboarding experience extreme agony as it induces an overwhelming and prolonged sensation of imminent death.A report of the U.S. Department of Justice showed that victims of waterboarding often resorted to fabricating false confessions or even admitting crimes they did not commit to escape further torture.Since its inception in 2002 by the U.S. military outside the U.S. territory, the Guantanamo detention camp has been marred by a flagrant breach of human rights.Raul Capote, editor-in-chief of the Cuban newspaper Granma International, noted that endless detention without fair and lawful trials at Guantanamo led to the deteriorating health of the detainees.\"LUCRATIVE DEAL\"The U.S. intelligence apparatus also exploited the \"black sites\" to reap substantial profits from government coffers and fabricate false claims of success in counterterrorism.American taxpayers were burdened with an annual expense of 540 million U.S. dollars to sustain the ongoing operation of the Guantanamo camp, even when the number of detainees there has declined to a mere 30, The New York Times reported.The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has struck deals with certain countries and tribes, whereby the U.S. government bought alleged \"terrorist suspects\" from those entities at exorbitant prices ranging from 3,000 to 25,000 dollars, The Associated Press reported.U.S. media outlets also uncovered that the CIA paid a private company nearly 80 million dollars for the purpose of designing torture programs.Despite the repeated exposure of human rights violations at the \"black sites,\" no U.S. official has been held accountable for developing, authorizing or carrying out covert arrest and torture programs.The U.S. breach of human rights has also drawn harsh criticism and condemnation from the international community and experts worldwide.In 2020, the International Criminal Court (ICC) resumed its investigation into the grave crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by all parties involved in the conflict in Afghanistan, including U.S. forces.Then ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said there was \"reasonable\" suspicion of war crimes by the U.S. forces in Afghanistan as well as by the CIA in \"black sites\" across the globe, U.S.-based organization Human Rights Watch reported.Ni Aolain urged the U.S. government to provide judicial assistance and apologies to the victims at Guantanamo, and to guarantee the non-repetition of such human rights violations.Despite vaunting itself as a self-proclaimed \"beacon of democracy\" and champion of \"freedom and human rights,\" the United States has, in reality, committed crimes in flagrant violation of human rights, international law, the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions, said Najib Khalaf, a professor of law at Al-Iraqia University.Instead of acknowledging the crimes and making apologies, the United States chose to turn a deaf ear to the global outcry.In response to a report by the UN Committee Against Torture on the abuse at U.S. overseas \"black sites,\" the U.S. government refused to disclose information regarding detainees involved in the CIA activities, citing confidentiality reasons.', 'Guantanamo gag detention sites CIA crimes He detainees TORTU', '2023-07-15', ' (Xinhua) 14:49, July 15, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Stepping out of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility onto the road to', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0715/c90000-20044774.html');

(Xinhua/Deng Hua)BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China\'s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector has entered a new stage of high-quality development, marked by a steady increase in output, sales, exports, and consumption potential.The country has seen its NEV output growing exponentially. The 20 millionth NEV rolled off the production line on July 3 in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, marking a milestone for the sector. The accumulative NEV output only exceeded 10 million units in February last year.In the first half of 2023, the NEV output expanded 42.4 percent year on year to nearly 3.79 million units, while the NEV sales surged 44.1 percent year on year to almost 3.75 million units, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed.The country exported 534,000 NEVs during the same period, expanding 160 percent from a year earlier.BYD, one of China\'s fastest-growing electric vehicle makers, has exported its automobiles to over 70 countries and regions.China\'s NEV sector is gaining a competitive edge in scale and quality, and the Chinese-branded vehicles exported are cost-effective, said Zhu Yifang, a researcher at the automotive strategy and policy research center under the China Automotive Technology and Research Center Co., Ltd.Building on the robust growth momentum, China has stepped up policy support in the NEV sector, particularly in its vast rural areas.In May, China released a guideline to support people living in rural areas to purchase NEVs, focusing on boosting the construction of charging infrastructure.To further unleash the domestic consumption potential, China extended its preferential purchase tax policy for NEVs to the end of 2027.Preliminary estimates show the policy will result in 520 billion yuan (about 72.91 billion U.S. dollars) in tax exemptions and reductions.Infrastructure, including charging facilities, has also seen a notable improvement in recent years.The number of charging piles has increased from less than 100,000 in 2015 to 5.21 million in 2022. By the end of May this year, China\'s charging piles reached nearly 6.36 million.As of the end of 2022, there were 226 vehicles per 1,000 people in China, and many families had never owned a car. The auto market still has massive room for growth, said Fu Bingfeng, executive vice president and secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.With NEVs becoming more popular among Chinese consumers, third- and fourth-tier cities and rural areas may record faster market growth, Fu said, adding that the number of vehicles per 1,000 people will likely reach 400 in the future.The NEV sector has entered a new stage of large-scale, globalized, and high-quality development, becoming an important part of China\'s modern industrial system, said Fu.', 'Aion Chinas sector GAC output charging NEVs Energy number ru', '2023-07-17', ' (Xinhua) 08:17, July 17, 2023', 'This photo taken on July 3, 2023 shows the final inspection line at the general assembly workshop o', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-17 20:19:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0717/c90000-20044811.html');

The globe is heating up. Beijing\'s alert for high temperatures is no exception, as the whole world saw its hottest days on record last week. Reversing climate change hardly brooks any delay.China and the United States, as the world\'s top two economies, bear the common responsibility for driving forward global climate actions that can cool down the sizzling Earth.At the same time, the U.S. climate envoy is also expected to help calm the inflamed tensions between the two countries, following the efforts of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who paid visits to Beijing over the past month.These interactions are a good sign for preventing further miscalculations, and steering bilateral relations back on track.Both sides are anticipating practical outcomes and meaningful actions. To achieve those, both must show their sincerity for genuine cooperation, otherwise any promises for progress on relations are just empty talk.It is especially true for the White House to bear in mind that seeking to compartmentalize cooperation with -- or competition and suppression against -- China in bilateral ties is simply unrealistic in practice and unacceptable for Beijing.For China-U.S. cooperation to be healthy and sustainable, bilateral ties must be treated as a whole.Climate cooperation is deemed as an important component in China-U.S. exchanges. The synergy between these two countries once gave a huge push to the historic Paris accord, and paved the way for wider breakthroughs in global carbon emission reduction, which proves that progress can be made when the two countries try to meet halfway, even when bilateral relations encounter severe setbacks.Secretary Yellen has embraced the Chinese view that the world is big enough for both countries to thrive. While extreme heatwave is baking this planet, the world is also hot enough for Beijing and Washington to act together for the sake of human existence.Kerry\'s trip offers a chance for the two sides to build up more consensus for cooperation to lower the heat for the highly-charged bilateral ties and a warming-up planet.However, prior to his visit, some media outlets reported that the White House is working to roll out new restrictions on American investments in China. If that is the case, those actions would certainly not help cool down tensions in China-U.S. ties, but push them up.

According to Yoshiko, this material was commonly used for clothing during China\'s Tang Dynasty and Japan\'s Nara period. It saw a sharp decline in production after the advent of cotton and is now at risk of disappearing. Though Yoshiko\'s own use of the fabric is modest, she transforms these materials into artworks, granting them a renewed sense of longevity before their potential extinction.\"Many of my creations are motivated by a desire to revive and celebrate traditional materials,\" said Yoshiko. \"I contemplate what I can do to preserve these endangered materials, ensuring they are not forgotten or lost to history.\"To keep the legacy of traditional Chinese crafts alive, Yoshiko has also taken on the role of an instructor who delivers lectures to art enthusiasts at Qiankun Space, imparting her knowledge of traditional Chinese engravings and shedding light on their beauty and cultural significance. She recognizes that by actively engaging in the transmission of these precious traditions, she contributes to the preservation and continuity of these ancestral treasures.\"The techniques and craftsmanship we study today are not inventions of our generation but treasures passed down by our ancestors,\" she said. \"It is our duty to carry forward these invaluable gifts from the past to the 21st century and beyond.\"Through her lectures on Chinese cultural heritage, she nurtures young minds, which not only ensures its survival but also inspires others to appreciate the beauty and significance embedded within the rich heritage.\"I will continually hone my own skills, with the aim of passing on these valuable techniques to as many individuals as possible who have a genuine interest in learning,\" she said.As Yoshiko\'s captivating artwork and lectures find a home within the ancient hutong, hearts unite in admiration of her enchanting creations.

The official mentioned, in particular, his \"vivid\" memories of the involvement of the Chinese navy in the fight against piracy in the Gulf of Aden.Charles Richard Mondjo, Congolese minister of National Defense, inspects an honor guard of the Chinese naval fleet at the port of Pointe-Noire, economic capital of the Republic of the Congo, July 14, 2023.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Commentary: Another step to steer China-U.S. relations back on track - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Frequent high-level interactions are the latest steps towards a detente between China and the United States.Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs Wang Yi met Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jakarta, their second meeting within only one month. Earlier this month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also visited Beijing.Last year in Bali, the two countries\' heads of state reached a consensus that set the direction for China-U.S. relations. However, bilateral relations have gone off course owing largely to a string of Washington\'s misconceived words and deeds against China.For the world to become better, the China-U.S. relationship brooks no further retrogression. By receiving Blinken and Yellen, China hopes that Washington will work together with Beijing to truly translate the common understandings reached by the two presidents into concrete actions, to steer China-U.S. relations back on track.To this end, the two countries need to properly manage differences and remain undisturbed by all sorts of distractions so as to create favorable conditions for stabilizing their relations. The pair should guard against Gray Rhino events, which might have a disruptive impact on bilateral relations, and properly handle Black Swan events to ensure that they won\'t evolve into new challenges.The U.S. side should fully respect China\'s core interests, refrain from unwarranted interference in China\'s internal affairs and violation of China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, give up attempts to oppress and contain China in trade and technology, and lift unjustified and unreasonable sanctions imposed on China.Most imperative is to jointly explore and establish guiding principles or strategic frameworks for China-U.S. relations. Beijing has always hoped for a sound and stable China-U.S. relationship, believing that the two sides can overcome all obstacles and find the right way to get along with each other on the basis of the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.To stabilize and improve China-U.S. relations, America needs to reflect on what sent the relations into a downward spiral, translate the Bali consensus into concrete actions and implement those commitments made by U.S. President Joe Biden.Biden has made multiple pledges that the United States does not seek a new Cold War with China, that it does not aim to change China\'s system, that the revitalization of its alliance is not targeted at China, that the United States does not support \"Taiwan independence\" and that it has no intention to seek a conflict with China. It remains to be seen if Washington will follow through on these commitments.Yawei Liu, director of the China Program at The Carter Center, argued that it\'s up to the United States whether the bilateral relations can improve.The recent high-level interactions indicate that both sides aspire to a detente. This momentum needs to be maintained, and sincerity is a prerequisite for constructive communication. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yellen\'s trip had aided fragile efforts by the two sides to keep talking, but warned that \"going any further is likely to test Washington and Beijing\'s ability to resist tit-for-tat measures.\"The peaceful coexistence of the world\'s two largest economies is crucial for the future and destiny of humanity. China has always demonstrated sufficient sincerity in seeking dialogue to improve relations with the United States, which stand at a crossroads.There is still hope, notably with the upcoming visit of U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and a possible trip by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, that bilateral relations may go back on the right track. But if Washington persists in playing the old trick of double-dealing, or even becomes all the more bent on containing China, chances are that China-U.S. relations will spiral downward into an abyss of confrontations and conflicts.', 'relations China-U that bilateral Chinas Bali translate sides', '2023-07-17', ' (Xinhua) 11:03, July 17, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Frequent high-level interactions are the latest steps towards a detente', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-17 20:19:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0717/c90000-20045110.html');
INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Passing bumps in the road: what we can learn from FAW\'s 70-year journey - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- In the northeastern city of Changchun, the humble automobile is a shining light against which all other sights of the city seem dim. You would be hard-pressed to find another city in China that is so deeply connected to, and heavily affected by automobiles.Known as the cradle of China\'s automotive industry, Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, is home to FAW Group Co., Ltd., the nation\'s first auto manufacturer that celebrated its 70th anniversary on Saturday.FAW\'s history is the very embodiment of China\'s auto industry -- from conception to birth, and from weakness to strength.SELF-RELIANCE: THE LONG HARD SLOGFAW started from scratch as an important part of China\'s first five-year plan.At that time, rebuilding was an urgent task facing the newly founded People\'s Republic of China (PRC). Hundreds of millions wondered when they would be able to ride in a locally made car.During the plant\'s three-year construction, hundreds of cadres were sent to help, and a large number of skilled workers from Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin set off for Changchun. Graduates from top universities and returned students also joined in.When the first batch of Jiefang trucks rolled off the production line in 1956, engineers and technicians immediately went forward to lift the hood, listening to the roaring of the engine. The crowd burst into triumphant laughter when it gradually stopped, the People\'s Daily reported.In May 1958, China\'s first prototype Dongfeng model was produced by FAW. The first Hongqi luxury sedan was produced mere months later. The Hongqi open-top limousine made its debut in Beijing at the 10th anniversary of the founding of the PRC.With China\'s reform and opening up, imported cars flooded into the Chinese market from the mid- to late 1980s. FAW established a joint venture with Volkswagen in 1991, starting to produce the Jetta cars, which became one of the most popular compact models in China along with the VW Santana and Citroen ZX.China\'s auto industry has never forgotten the importance of independent innovation. Its path can be characterized by the development model of a latecomer country -- independent innovation based on introduction.This mode develops technologies and products with independent intellectual property rights through introduction, digestion, absorption and innovation, and establishes a relatively complete automobile industry system with independent development and manufacturing capabilities, national brands and a domestic auto parts supply system.As the backbone of China\'s auto industry, FAW absorbed technologies from its foreign partners and developed its own Hongqi brand, which was a long, hard slog.EMBRACING CHANGE: THE WINNING FORMULAFAW\'s \"market for technology\" strategy was anything but smooth, even counterproductive at times. There was a period when its self-owned brands lagged significantly behind those of the joint ventures, both in terms of product quality and market recognition.As is often said, the rising tide covers many things, but when it goes out, you learn who\'s been swimming naked.Geng Zhaojie, a veteran automobile executive who served as head of FAW for 14 years from 1985, remained calm and sober-minded when foreign businesses entered China\'s auto market.\"Without our own brand, no matter how many cars we make, the pride is not ours,\" warned Geng, believing that independent development of self-owned brands was the only way to avoid China\'s automakers becoming OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) of foreign brands.China\'s entry into the WTO accelerated the globalization of the auto industry. Facing a sudden influx of foreign brands, China\'s local enterprises faced accelerated market competition, which made FAW realize that only reform and innovation could help it keep up with the pace.According to Li Zhihong, director of the general manager\'s office of FAW-Volkswagen, automobile joint ventures have played an important role in talent training and laid a solid foundation for China to become a global power in auto manufacturing.Change is the only constant, and embracing it is the magic formula to stay ahead of the game.In September 2017, FAW launched a major reform of its institutional setup, personnel management and salary system. The drastic reform has stimulated the vitality of innovation, and rejuvenated Hongqi, a homegrown brand that is deeply cherished in the hearts of Chinese people.The global automotive industry is now accelerating its electrified and intelligent transition. With a world-leading market of new energy vehicles (NEVs) and strong industrial chains, China finds itself among the company of the global automobile powers.This transition has also brought historical opportunities for national brands like Hongqi, which has recently announced it will direct all of its investment in technological innovation into NEVs, as well as all of its new production capacity, aiming at selling 500,000 Hongqi NEVs by 2025.China\'s vehicle exports soared to around 1.07 million units in the first quarter of 2023, making China the world\'s largest auto exporter in the period, outpacing Japan.Meanwhile, FAW has been accelerating the expansion of Hongqi in the overseas high-end auto market, and is planning to boost overseas sales of Hongqi to a level where it will account for over 10 percent of Hongqi\'s total sales by 2025, and 25 percent by 2030.Qiu Xiandong, FAW\'s general manager, expressed the company\'s determination and confidence in transitioning to NEVs. Hongqi products are going to be younger, more fashionable and more tech-empowered, he said.STAY STRONG, BETTER TOGETHERIt has been said that almost every family in Changchun can name a relative, not to mention a friend, who is engaged in automobile-related work.Ever since the birth of the first car, FAW\'s development has been closely linked to that of the city and even the whole province of Jilin. Yet Changchun was once bringing up the rear of China\'s automobile surge.In recent years, the local government has not only stepped up efforts in infrastructure renovation for FAW, but also actively supported its reform and development.As China\'s only state-level development zone named after the automobile industry, where FAW headquarters is located, Changchun\'s automobile economic and technological development zone has been improving the business environment, attracting further investment from multinationals.Building an international automotive city covering the automobile, auto parts and automobile service industries is what Changchun is driving toward, a transformation together with FAW that aims to boost China\'s automobile industry.Changchun and FAW are embracing brand new opportunities for growth on the way to realizing this vision. Their fates are intertwined even more closely than ever.', 'the setup Chinas sedan automobile Hongqi brands Changchun in', '2023-07-17', ' (Xinhua) 11:05, July 17, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- In the northeastern city of Changchun, the humble automobile is a shini', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-17 20:19:21', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0717/c90000-20045112.html');

(Xinhua/Li Ying)LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz of Spain thwarted Novak Djokovic\'s quest for a record-leveling 24th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon on Sunday. Overcoming an early setback, the 20-year-old defeated second-seeded Djokovic 1-6, 7-6 (6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 to clinch his second Grand Slam trophy.The reigning US Open champion, who had previously endured a semifinal loss to the Serbian just a month ago at Roland Garros, was making his second Grand Slam final appearance. In contrast, 36-year-old Djokovic was stepping onto that stage for a record 35th time.In an intense battle lasting four hours and 43 minutes, both players demonstrated exceptional skills and mental tenacity. But, it was the Spaniard who better maintained his composure in the decider, securing the victory with an early break in the third game. This marked Djokovic\'s first defeat at Wimbledon since 2017 and his first on Center Court in 10 years.\"It\'s a dream come true for me,\" Alcaraz said during the trophy ceremony. \"Of course it\'s great to win but even if I had lost, I would be really proud of myself with this amazing run, making history in this beautiful tournament, playing a final against a legend of our sport.\"\"It\'s amazing for a boy, 20 years old, I didn\'t expect to reach these kinds of situations really fast.

Djokovic, however, responded swiftly, saving a break point in game four to level the set at 2-2.As the set progressed, it became a closely contested affair that led to a tiebreak. Although Djokovic took a 3-0 lead in the tiebreak, Alcaraz rallied back, fending off a set point at 5-6.\"I would say the tiebreak in the second. The backhands kind of let me down, to be honest. Set point, I missed the backhand. He did play a backhand that was quite long in the court, had a little bit of a bad bounce. But I should not have missed that shot,\" Djokovic reflected.Facing a set point at 6-7, Djokovic served-and-volleyed, but Alcaraz capitalized on it with a powerful return, securing the 85-minute second set to level the final.Capitalizing on his newly-found momentum, Alcaraz leaped to a 2-0 advantage in the third set, as Djokovic began to show signs of fatigue. The fifth game turned into a marathon, with Alcaraz finally taking a double break to lead 4-1 after 13 deuces and his seventh break point opportunity.Djokovic managed to fend off a pair of break points to level the fourth set at 1-1, thereby regaining some momentum. He capitalized on this shift, carving a 4-2 lead for himself.The Serb\'s regained momentum was enough to take the final into a deciding set as the contest approached the four-hour mark.Alcaraz thrilled the crowd when he fired a backhand winner down the line to break Djokovic\'s serve for a 2-1 lead in the deciding set. Djokovic\'s frustration was palpable as he smashed his racquet against the wooden net post, earning himself a code violation. Alcaraz capitalized on this single break to wrap up a historic victory when Djokovic netted the final shot.As many deemed this match as one signaling a generational shift, Alcaraz sought to downplay such discussions.\"I did it for myself, not for the tennis generation. Winning against Novak at his best on this court and to be the guy who beat him after 10 years unbeaten on this court, it\'s amazing,\" Alcaraz said.Players greet each other after the men\'s singles final match between Novak Djokovic of Serbia and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain at Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Britain, July 16, 2023.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('UN chief regrets Russia\'s decision to end Black Sea grain deal - People\'s Daily Online', 'UNITED NATIONS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday said he regretted Russia\'s decision to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\"I deeply regret the decision by the Russian Federation to terminate the implementation of the Black Sea Initiative, including the withdrawal of Russian security guarantees for navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea,\" Guterres said.With the decision to terminate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Russia also terminated its commitment to facilitate the unimpeded export of food, sunflower oil, and fertilizers from Ukrainian-controlled Black Sea ports, as expressed in the memorandum of understanding between Russia and the United Nations, he told a press encounter at the UN headquarters in New York.The initiative has ensured the safe passage of over 32 million metric tons of food commodities from Ukrainian ports. The World Food Programme has shipped more than 725,000 tons to support humanitarian operations, relieving hunger in some of the hardest-hit corners of the world, including Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and Yemen, noted Guterres.The Black Sea Grain Initiative brokered by the United Nations and Türkiye -- together with the memorandum of understanding between Russia and the world body -- has been a lifeline for global food security and a beacon of hope in a troubled world. At a time when the production and availability of food are being disrupted by conflict, climate change, energy prices and more, these agreements have helped to reduce food prices by over 23 percent since March last year, he added.\"Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice. But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don\'t have a choice. Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis. They will pay the price,\" said Guterres, noting that there was already a jump in wheat prices immediately after the announcement of the Russian decision.Earlier Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow decided to suspend its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative.\"Unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements that concerns Russia has not been implemented so far, so its effect is terminated,\" local media reported, citing Peskov. Russia had been complaining that its demands to improve its own grain and fertilizer exports have not been met.Peskov noted that the country will immediately return to the deal when the Russian part of the agreements is fulfilled.Guterres on Monday pledged to continue to facilitate food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine and Russia despite the Russian decision.\"Today\'s decision by the Russian Federation will strike a blow to people in need everywhere. But it will not stop our efforts to facilitate the unimpeded access to global markets for food products and fertilizers from both Ukraine and the Russian Federation,\" he said. \"Looking ahead, our goal must continue to be advancing global food security and global food price stability. This will remain the focus of my efforts, taking into account the rise in human suffering that will inevitably result from today\'s decision. We will stay fixed on finding pathways for solutions. There is simply too much at stake in a hungry and hurting world.\"Guterres said he was \"deeply disappointed\" that his proposal for the renewal of the Black Sea grain deal went unheeded.\"I am aware of some obstacles that remained in the foreign trade of Russian food and fertilizer products. That is precisely why I sent a letter to (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin with a new proposal to keep the Black Sea Initiative alive,\" said Guterres.At the press encounter, Guterres read out parts of his letter, which contained the efforts of the United Nations to facilitate the export of Russian grain and fertilizers, including a bespoke payment mechanism for the Russian Agricultural Bank through JP Morgan outside SWIFT, a messaging network through which international payments are initiated.Most of the Russian banks were kicked out of the SWIFT system following the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict last year.The United Nations also brokered a concrete proposal to enable a subsidiary of the Russian Agricultural Bank to regain access to SWIFT with the European Commission, said Guterres. \"The key element underpinning this proposal\'s political viability is that it can be implemented within existing regulations. We see this as a unique political opening, stemming from a genuine desire to protect global food security beyond July 17.\"The letter was sent on Tuesday last week.UN General Assembly President Csaba Korosi on Monday also deeply regretted Russia\'s decision to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.For 12 months, this initiative has provided a lifeline to millions of people hit hard by the global food security crisis triggered by the conflict in Ukraine. To date, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has facilitated the export of over 32 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs, directly feeding the people of the world and stabilizing global prices, said Paulina Kubiak, Korosi\'s spokesperson, in a statement.Korosi commends the tireless efforts of the UN secretary-general as well as the exemplary work of the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which was responsible for the operationalization of the initiative. He recognizes also the efforts of the Turkish government, said the statement.\"As is so often the case, the most vulnerable people suffer when food supply is short and prices rise, as we are already witnessing today. Therefore, the president reiterates his call on the parties to return to dialogue,\" it said. \"The challenges are complex, they are interconnected. But they are not insurmountable. It is not too late.\"Russia and Ukraine signed separately with Türkiye and the United Nations the Black Sea Grain Initiative in Istanbul in July 2022, which allowed Ukraine to export its grain and other agricultural products from its Black Sea ports. As a parallel agreement, Russia and the United Nations signed a memorandum of understanding on the facilitation of Russian food and fertilizer exports.The Black Sea Grain Initiative, which was initially valid for 120 days, was extended in mid-November 2022 for another 120 days until March 18, 2023. Russia then agreed to extend the deal for only 60 days.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('NATO in Cold War dream undermines global peace, stability - People\'s Daily Online', 'The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit, which was held on July 11 and 12, once again revealed the organization\'s Cold War mentality. It issued a communique that distorted China\'s position and policies and deliberately smeared China, exposing NATO\'s dangerous attempt to meddle in affairs beyond its geographical scope, create division, and foment confrontation.This proved that NATO has never reflected on the troubles and disasters it has brought around the world, which plunged many of its member countries into security dilemmas. However, it is still in its Cold War dream, seeking further expansion and creating new troubles around the globe.As a so-called defensive alliance, NATO \"defends\" itself by waging wars. After the end of the Cold War, it has repeatedly lit the fuse of confrontation and created wars around the world, from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Kosovo, from Afghanistan to Iraq, and from Libya to Syria.According to incomplete statistics, the wars launched or participated in by NATO after 2001 have killed hundreds of thousands and displaced tens of millions of people.The root cause for the current warfare and security dilemmas in Europe is NATO\'s long-term addiction to expansion and confrontation. George Kennan, the former U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union noted that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-Cold War era.NATO has unshirkable responsibilities for the Ukraine crisis. Before the crisis escalated, the Minsk Agreements reached by relevant parties and the efforts made by the international community could have had the opportunity to maintain peace. However, NATO kept provoking conflicts, which once again brought the European continent to warfare.Since the full escalation of the Ukraine crisis, NATO took advantage of the situation and tried to expand and perpetuate the crisis, which made it more difficult to resolve the crisis through political means. Facts prove that the so-called defensive alliance is exactly a saboteur of global peace and stability.Again, the NATO summit this time invited a few Asia-Pacific countries, with an aim to enhance its collusion with the latter. It even blatantly claimed that the \"Indo-Pacific is important for NATO.\"However, NATO\'s intention to move eastward to the Asia-Pacific region is all too clear. The claim that it remains a regional alliance and does not seek a geopolitical breakthrough is just weakly stated.The scope of NATO\'s activities is far beyond the North Atlantic region. Over the years, the organization has taken great pains to expand its so-called partnership network.It meddles in the affairs of Eurasia with its Partnership for Peace program, interferes in the affairs of the Middle East and North Africa with the Mediterranean Dialogue, plans to enter the Gulf with the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and expands toward the Asia-Pacific region with a global partnership program.A trick frequently used by NATO to seek expansion is fanning up the so-called \"security threat\" and provoking value confrontation. At the NATO summit this time, the alliance arbitrarily sold the \"China threat\" theory and groundlessly claimed that China is a \"systemic challenge.\" Its true intention was to peddle security fear and seek excuses for its expansion into the Asia-Pacific.To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of the Asia-Pacific, regional countries need to respect each other, carry out open and win-win cooperation and properly handle their disputes. NATO\'s eastward foray into the Asia-Pacific would only intensify regional tension and trigger bloc confrontation and even a new Cold War.Asia-Pacific countries do not welcome NATO\'s expansion to the region, and even many NATO states do not approve of it. The Asia-Pacific does not need an \"Asia-Pacific version of NATO.\"Javier Solana, former Secretary General of NATO, noted that \"global NATO\" or \"NATO plus\" could divide the world into adversarial blocs.The hot and cold wars of the last century indicated that expanding military blocs and creating bloc confrontation can never bring peace and security, but only lead to wars and conflicts.NATO seemingly follows the principle of consensus-based decision-making, but it prioritizes the interests of the United States and its actions mirror American wills. The theory of the so-called \"China threat\" hyped at this NATO summit is highly identical to the false information about China spread by the United States, which fully revealed the intention of Washington to transform NATO into a hegemonic tool oppressing China.Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once stated at the end of the 1990s that U.S. support for greater European efforts would be contingent on avoiding \"three D\'s:\" discrimination against non-EU NATO members, decoupling of European and North American security, and duplication of NATO’s operational planning system or its command structure.In other words, it\'s a must for the United States to keep its control over European security via NATO, and Europe\'s goal of strengthening strategic independence and defense construction must make way for American hegemony.Over the past more than three decades, NATO has shifted its strategic focus for times, from pushing for expansion in Central and Eastern Europe to interfering in other countries\' internal affairs around the world, and to buckling down to anti-terrorism after the war in Afghanistan.Today, it refocuses on major-country rivalry and accelerates its eastward foray into the Asia-Pacific. These changes are highly consistent with the United States foreign policy adjustment.However, a \"NATO under the rein of the United States\" is not consistent with European interests. Just as French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated, European countries need to develop more strategic autonomy lest the continent become a \"vassal\" in the event of a great-power confrontation. The top priority of Europe is not cooperating with other countries on agendas around the world, and Europe should not fall into bloc confrontation.The world today is different from the one that was trapped in the Cold War. NATO should immediately stop smearing China and fabricating lies about China, abandon the outdated philosophies of the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game, give up its erroneous addiction to military expansion, stop seeking so-called absolute security, and stop troubling Europe and the Asia-Pacific. It must quit seeking excuses for its expansion and play a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability.', 'nato', '2023-07-18', 'By Huan Yuping (People\'s Daily) 09:16, July 18, 2023', 'The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit, which was held on July 11 and 12, once again r', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045577.html');

If everything goes according to plan, it will be finished around November and will then start initial operation,\" he told China Daily in an exclusive interview.Last month, Angolan President Joao Manuel Goncalves Lourenco visited the construction site for the second time this year, inspecting main infrastructure.The president was satisfied with the construction progress and told relevant government departments to give full support to the project, according to Liu\'s company.Along with the Angolan capital\'s existing Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport, the new airport, located about 40 kilometers southeast of the city center of Luanda, will help to handle the rising number of people traveling to the African metropolis.Upon its completion, the airport will become one of the most important air hubs in Africa. It will have a total area of 43 hectares, consisting of two modern runways and large terminal buildings.The massive compound will be able to facilitate about 100,000 flights each year and will boast an initial annual throughput of 15 million passengers.To take advantage of the air hub, the Angolan government has planned to construct office buildings, hotels, conference and exhibition halls, bonded zones and logistics facilities surrounding the new airport.According to Liu, the airport\'s infrastructure will be characterized by eco-friendly and energy-efficient technologies and equipment, and will have a wide range of smart devices, promising comfortable and convenient transit for passengers.\"We introduced a lot of advanced Chinese engineering machines to build the airport and installed top-tier Chinese civil aviation equipment.

Asked whether the growth rate in the second quarter was slower or faster than expected at the press conference, Fu said China\'s economy remains on a positive stable trend, noting a 5.5-percent growth in the first half is faster than the 3-percent growth in 2022 and the average annual growth rate of 4.5 percent over the three years under COVID-19. \"The recovery trend of economic growth is relatively significant,\" he said, noting China\'s growth rate in the first half is still the fastest among all major economies.Chinese analysts, pointing to global downward pressure and sluggish domestic demand in some areas, also maintained that the growth rate fell largely within expectation.\"The 5.5-percent growth rate in the first half is the same as our previous forecast. The 6.3-percent growth rate in the second quarter is indeed a bit low, but it is not too low and is basically in line with expectations,\" Tian Yun, a Beijing-based economist, told the Global Times on Monday. \"China\'s economic growth - both in terms of its accelerating recovery and contribution to global growth - is obvious for all to see.\"Notably, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, China\'s GDP grew 0.8 percent in the second quarter of 2023, beating a 0.5-percent quarter-on-quarter growth rate projected by Reuters. The year-on-year growth rate of 6.3 percent also means the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2021, when growth hit 8.3 percent.Economists also pointed out that the 6.3-percent growth rate in the second quarter is hard-won and actually showed the resilience of the Chinese economy, as the growth was achievement without broad-based economic stimulus and as traditional growth boosters such as exports and real estate faced slowing pressures.\"The achievement is hard-won amid multiple domestic and external challenges. It reflects that Chinese consumers\' confidence wasn\'t seriously damaged and that the country\'s dual circulation development paradigm driven by high-tech sector offsets slowdown in external demand,\" Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, told the Global Times on Monday.Calls for policy supportStill, going forward, major challenges are likely to remain and more policy support is needed to boost expectation and stabilize growth, officials and economists said.\"To shift from restorative growth to sustained growth, we need to strengthen endogenous force, address the problem of income growth and carry out fundamental reform measures to restore confidence,\" Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, told the Global Times on Monday, pointing to weak private investment, which, he said, reflects lack of confidence and negative sentiment.Chinese officials have said that China\'s economy remains in a critical period of recovery, which often comes with challenges. At a press conference on Friday, Liu Guoqiang, deputy governor of the People\'s Bank of China (PBC), the central bank, said challenges are normal during the recovery process, which is internationally believed will take about one year and it\'s only been half a year for China\'s recovery.On Monday, Fu also noted that in the next stage, the external environment will likely become more complex and severe and domestic economic development will also face pressure. Still, pointing to improving employment, growing income, strengthening internal demand, among others, Fu said, \"we have the confidence, the condition and the capability for accomplishing the expected goals and tasks of economic and social development for the whole year.\"China has set a GDP growth target of around 5 percent for 2023. Economists are also confident the growth target will be met and could even be exceeded.\"It is highly likely that the full-year GDP growth rate will reach above 5 percent, and with strong policy stimulus, could reach as high as 5.5 percent,\" Lian Ping, chief economist and head of the Zhixin Investment Research Institute, told the Global Times on Monday.Lian noted the intensity of macro policy adjustment needs to be further strengthened to support private firms, restore the property market, increase youth employment, expand consumption and prevent risks. Specifically, Lian called for further fee and tax reduction and increased financing for major areas such as real estate, manufacturing and small businesses.Chinese officials have also vowed increased support for small businesses, the private sector, the real estate market as well as the real economy in recent meetings and policy documents. For example, Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Wednesday held a meeting with representatives from private e-commerce giants including Alibaba, Douyin, Xiaohongshu and Meituan, sending a strong signal of support. A meeting of the central commission for deepening overall reform last week stressed efforts to put in place new systems for a higher-standard open economy.On Friday, PBC officials also said that the central bank will use policy tools such as the reserve requirement ratio and medium-term lending facility when necessary to address challenges and ensure stable growth in the second half of the year.More policy support for various sectors, including foreign trade and domestic consumption, is expected, as officials are scheduled to hold more press conference on different aspects of the economy this week.Tian said relatively urgent measures like the removal of administrative restrictions on consumption, including certain restrictions on car purchases in some cities, need to be instituted. He also said foreign trade could see some improvements, if increasing talks between Chinese and US officials result in eased trade tension.In the latest sign of growing interactions, China\'s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday that it holds an open and welcoming attitudetoward a potential visit by US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, while calling on the US to remove additional tariffs on Chinese goods.', 'growth recovery rate Chinas percent officials challenges Lia', '2023-07-18', 'By Wang Cong and Ma Jingjing (Global Times) 09:30, July 18, 2023', 'Chinese officials said on Monday China\'s economy expanded by 6.3 percent year-on-year in the second', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045614.html');
INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('It\'s crucial to objectively assess China\'s economy - People\'s Daily Online', 'The data released by China\'s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Monday showed that the country\'s gross domestic product (GDP) for the first half of this year reached 59.3034 trillion yuan. Calculated at constant prices, it grew by 5.5 percent year-on-year. This growth rate is faster than the 3 percent annual economic growth rate of the previous year and the average 4.5 percent growth rate over the three years during the pandemic, making it the fastest among major global economies based on published data. Due to the significant role of the Chinese economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that China will contribute about one-third of global economic growth this year. Therefore, in the context of a sluggish global economy, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience and sustained healthy development, which is of great global significance.The world is closely watching China\'s economic data and conducting various analyses and predictions around it, which is quite normal. With its enormous size, China\'s economic development trajectory has reached a point where it can significantly impact the global economy. China remains one of the fastest-growing major economies, and according to IMF forecasts, it will be the largest contributor to global economic growth in the next five years, with its share of contribution expected to reach 22.6 percent of the total world GDP growth, twice that of the US. Therefore, in the current complex domestic and international environment, it is crucial to objectively, comprehensively, and dialectically assess the Chinese economic situation to avoid misunderstanding and misjudgments.In terms of the first half of this year, although the Q2 growth fell slightly below market expectations, generally speaking a growth rate of 5.5 percent is still significant. From the data released by the NBS, it is not difficult to see that the Chinese economy has shown clear signs of structural improvement and optimized momentum. For example, there has been a significant increase in the contribution of consumption to economic growth, and the service sector has made substantial contributions. At the same time, new driving forces are rapidly developing, with notable growth in areas such as technological innovation and artificial intelligence. The production and export of \"new three\" items, represented by lithium batteries, solar cells, and electric passenger vehicles, have also seen significant increases. All of these indicate that the Chinese economy is continuously gaining momentum on a new track.From a long-term perspective, the objective conditions that support the continued growth of the Chinese economy still exist. For example, while China\'s manufacturing sector is already the largest in the world, there are still issues of being big but not strong, or comprehensive but not superior. This implies that future upgrades and replacements will bring tremendous development opportunities. At the same time, China\'s urbanization process is not yet complete, and the combined development of industrialization and urbanization will also demonstrate significant growth potential for the Chinese economy. What\'s more, China is the world\'s largest developing country, with a population of over 1.4 billion people who aspire to a better life and are willing to make real efforts toward it. This is the greatest driving force for China\'s development.Of course, this does not mean economic achievements will naturally occur; there will be challenges. Despite the recovery growth trend in the Chinese economy, there are still short-term challenges such as weak endogenous driving forces, insufficient effective demand, and unstable market expectations. We are facing considerable pressure. There are various reasons for this, but it also means that the entire Chinese society needs to continue to tighten its belt, demonstrate a spirit of hard work and struggle, and overcome new challenges. Especially, all regions and departments need to implement the central government\'s directives, show a strong sense of practicality, adhere to a problem-oriented, goal-oriented, and result-oriented approach, accelerate confidence-building measures throughout society, and maintain the momentum of economic growth.As we all know, expectations play a crucial role in economic life, and the importance of expectation management is even more pronounced in the current domestic and international environment. In the process of our economic recovery, confidence is more important than gold, and creating and nurturing positive expectations should be a joint effort of the government and society. It is particularly important that we take pragmatic policy measures to expand domestic demand and optimize structure, and boost confidence in enterprises, particularly private businesses. It is worth emphasizing that China still has an ample range of policy tools at its disposal. So far, China\'s stimulus policies for the economy have been relatively restrained, avoiding short-term stimulus measures that \"flood\" the economy. In the future, more targeted policies are expected to be introduced to incentivize private enterprises and stimulate the real estate market, among other areas. With the accumulation of positive factors promoting development, the economy is expected to continue its recovery and improvement. We should have sufficient confidence in this regard.Looking back at China\'s decades of development, there has never been a time when outstanding achievements were easily obtained. However, China possesses unique institutional advantages, and the Chinese people are diligent and hardworking. This united and determined nation has no reason to stagnate. We may now be entering a new uphill phase, facing numerous difficulties, but the direction is correct, and the fundamentals are sound. As long as we remain confident and work together, each goal will become a reality.

(Xinhua/Wu Zhizun)Despite facing challenges, crossing the Yangtze River has become a lifestyle for Wuhan people.WUHAN, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Every morning, before Tian Binqun, a 64-year-old doctor, heads to work in Wuhan, central China, he swims for half an hour in the Yangtze River, China\'s longest river, or the city\'s iconic East Lake.As a urologist at Wuhan University\'s Zhongnan Hospital, Tian begins work at 7 a.m. His work, filled with operations, is demanding. \"I\'ve come to realize how vital swimming is for my health and vitality, given my intense work schedule,\" he said.To maintain his swimming regimen, Tian rises at 5 a.m. when indoor pools are generally closed, making open water an optimal choice. \"I freshen up, drink some milk and then drive off to swim about a kilometer. This routine keeps me energetic for the day,\" Tian said.Tian was among more than 1,900 swimmers who participated in the Wuhan Yangtze River Crossing Festival, one of the world\'s most challenging swim events, on Sunday. He swam six kilometers during the renowned citywide physical fitness gala.Located at the confluence of the Yangtze River and its longest tributary, the Han River, Wuhan is home to 165 rivers and 166 lakes. These abundant water resources foster a deep-seated love for open-water swimming among Wuhan inhabitants.\"Many people in Wuhan swim in the Yangtze River because they want to challenge nature, endure tough conditions and build their resilience,\" said Yao Qin\'an, director of Wuhan\'s social sports instruction center. \"To some extent, the Wuhan population\'s penchant for crossing the Yangtze reflects the city\'s determined spirit.\"People participate in the Wuhan Yangtze River Crossing Festival on July 16, 2023. (Xinhua/Wu Zhizun)The Yangtze River\'s average width in the Wuhan section is 1.7 kilometers. Given the potential for wind, rapids and whirlpools, crossing the Yangtze is a significant challenge.\"Swimming in the Yangtze River is truly challenging. It\'s unlike any other competition course I\'ve experienced. The strong current makes for a challenging crossing, but it\'s immensely rewarding when you reach the other side,\" said Ashley Hogg, a PhD student from Manchester, England, who has competed in the festival four times and once placed fifth in the 1.8-kilometer race.Hogg added, \"The event requires strategic thinking and adaptation. It aligns with the city\'s slogan - \'Wuhan, different every day.\' One day, you need to aim in one direction to finish in a good time. But the following day or year, slower currents could render the same strategy ineffective, so constant adaptation, strategy, and rigorous training are required.\"People participate in the Wuhan Yangtze River Crossing Festival on July 16, 2023. (Xinhua/Wu Zhizun)While crossing the Yangtze has been a Wuhan tradition for decades, the sport faces challenges of continuity. Most open-water swimmers are over 50, with fewer young people showing interest.To engage younger generations, the Wuhan Yangtze River Crossing Festival\'s organizing committee began encouraging citizens under 35 in 2019 to form a youth phalanx to partake in the six-kilometer public swimming event in the Yangtze River.This year\'s youngest participant, 14-year-old Liu Enze, said, \"I\'m really happy to have finished the race. Although our phalanx consisted of 62 people, we kept good formation and it was quite relaxing.\" Liu started swimming in the Yangtze River with his father four years ago.Wuhan offers free swimming access in dozens of natatoriums to students in nine-year compulsory education during the summer holidays for about three weeks. \"We\'re also providing free training courses to over 3,000 primary and secondary school students this summer, teaching them swimming skills and lifesaving techniques,\" Yao added.The tide is beginning to turn. This year\'s Wuhan Yangtze River Crossing Festival champions were Huang Ziqi, a 15-year-old girl, and Wang Baojun, a 17-year-old boy.Tian, who founded a swimming association at his hospital this year, sees an encouraging trend. \"I was pleasantly surprised to see many young colleagues join the association with a keen interest in open-water swimming.

[Photo by Liu Jianhua/For China Daily]China\'s youth unemployment rate, which had increased in recent months, is expected to go down in August thanks to a recovering economy and the wide implementation of employment policies.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, the unemployment rate among surveyed young people, age 16 to 24, rose to 21.3 percent in June, compared with 20.8 percent in May and 20.4 percent in April.However, the unemployment rate in urban areas in June remained unchanged at 5.2 percent compared with May, data showed.Speaking at a news conference in Beijing on Monday, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said the youth unemployment rate sees \"seasonal fluctuations\". It goes up during graduation season due to the influx of young graduates into the job market.\"The rate will decrease gradually from August, with the graduation season coming to an end and young people landing jobs,\" Fu said.Pang Shi, director of the Chinese Academy of Personnel Science\'s department of employment and entrepreneurship, said the employment of young people is a global issue. China not only faces the common pressures of youth employment seen in other countries and regions, it also has specific problems because of its current stage of development, she said.The labor market experiences fluctuations as the economic cycle progresses, Pang said, noting that the imbalance between youth labor supply and market demand, as well as young people\'s career views, affects the group\'s employment prospects.\"For example, most young graduates still favor metropolises and large companies, State-owned companies and government departments being their top choices, while nearly 80 percent of market demand is from private companies,\" she said.Many graduates delay their job-seeking plans until after they receive their civil service exam results, and in the process miss out on job opportunities, Pang said.Also, information overload and mixed voices on the internet can trigger anxiety among young people, which may lower their confidence levels and affect their will to work, she added.Authorities at all levels have prioritized the employment of young people in recent years, and have launched and implemented a range of supportive policies and measures to help them land jobs, which in turn has protected their right to work.On June 6, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security launched a campaign that aims to collect information about more than 10 million job vacancies for college graduates and young people in 100 days.As part of the campaign, job fairs are being organized every week. Between July 10 and Sunday, four online job fairs were organized by the ministry. They attracted around 17,000 recruiters who offered 860,000 vacancies.The ministry also released China\'s first regulation on the management of human resources agencies recently to tighten supervision over their operations in order to ensure a safer job market, especially for young people who lack experience.The regulation applies to agencies and organizations offering human resources services, including collecting and publishing job information, offering consultancy and guidance, and having labor dispatching services. The regulation will take effect on Aug 1.Pang said the fundamental way of tackling youth employment challenges is developing the economy to create more job opportunities and improving the stability of these jobs.Private companies make a large contribution to both economic stability and job security, and authorities at all levels can formulate favorable policies to encourage them to create more vacancies, she added.', 'rate Youth improve August their Pang levels percent graduate', '2023-07-18', 'By CHENG SI (Chinadaily.com.cn) 09:42, July 18, 2023', 'Candidates look at employment opportunities at a job fair in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.

(Photo from LandSpace)China on July 12 successfully launched a new carrier rocket into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket is the world\'s first rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel and successfully entered its planned orbit, as well as the first liquid-propellant rocket entering its planned orbit independently developed by a Chinese private rocket company.The successful launch marked that China\'s first high-thrust liquid oxygen-methane engine has completed a flight mission, and a breakthrough in the new low-cost, liquid propellant application for China\'s carrier rockets.The Zhuque-2 is a two-stage rocket with a body diameter of 3.35 meters and a height of 49.5 meters. Its takeoff weight is about 219 tons, and its takeoff thrust is about 268 tons.The stage 1 of the rocket is powered by four Tianque-12 (TQ-12) engines each with a vacuum thrust of 80 tons, and the stage 2 by a single TQ-12 engine and four TQ-11 vernier engines.Carrier rocket, as a launch vehicle, is the foundation of all space activities, and the engine is the \"heart\" of a rocket, while the propellant decides the key performance of a rocket.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, July 12, 2023. (Photo from LandSpace)Rocket propellants include liquid fuels and solid fuels. In particular, liquid fuels include liquid oxygen (LOX)/kerosene, LOX/liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen-methane, etc. Each of the fuels has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the LOX/kerosene fuel features low cost and high specific impulse, but it\'s prone to carbon deposition and coking.Liquid oxygen-methane is a mixture of liquid oxygen and methane. It is efficient, green, cheap and easily extracted. It comes with less carbon deposition, which reduces the workload in engine cleaning and thus lowers the maintenance cost of reusable rockets. That\'s why it is considered one of the ideal materials for making rocket propellants.According to Zhang Changwu, CEO of LandSpace, the company that developed the Zhuque-2, liquid oxygen and methane are widely applied in both the civil and industrial sectors, and they are very accessible and cheap.The cost of this propellant, which is expected to become an industrial product in massive supply once the technology of liquid oxygen-methane engine matures, will be more controllable, Zhang added.Aerospace is a technologically challenging industry with high risks. The world today has entered a rapid development phase of reusable liquid oxygen-methane rockets. Multiple such rockets are underway outside China. In the first half of this year alone, two other liquid oxygen-methane rockets were launched, but they both failed unfortunately.The development of the Zhuque-2 carrier rocket was no plain sailing. At the end of the last year, it failed in its first mission. LandSpace established an investigation group to look into the reasons causing the failure and adopted multiple measures for improvement.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, July 12, 2023. (Photo from LandSpace)It was not easy for the company to achieve the success today after it experienced the failure in the first mission of the Zhuque-2. The development team did a huge amount of work, including launch tests, ground vibration tests, hydraulic tests and final assembly detection.\"What we achieved this time was not only a successful launch of a rocket, but also the capability of a private aerospace company in developing, testing, manufacturing and launching rockets. We\'ll keep going toward our goal of massive and commercial rocket development and manufacturing, and prove our value with innovation,\" Zhang said.As the first Chinese rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel, the Zhuque-2 is expected to lower the cost of commercial rocket launching and bring a revolution to the market of commercial rocket launching.Zhang said that the company will keep upgrading the Zhuque series to improve its performance and offer the market with low-cost, high-performance and high-thrust rockets.The private aerospace sector has experienced rapid development over the past 10 years and become an indispensable force in China\'s aerospace industry. It covers rocket launching, satellite and ground facility development, satellite operation, satellite application and other areas.According to statistics, China is home to more than 400 private aerospace companies that operate over 350 in-orbit satellites. The private aerospace sector has released considerable economic potential, with a market size of over 1 trillion yuan ($139.59 billion).Experts noted that China is seeing a significant increase in the frequency and number of space launches, as well as a huge demand for commercial launches.

As the old saying goes, bread is the staff of life. China\'s summer grain output, which totalled 146.13 million tonnes this year, has laid a solid foundation for global food security.This achievement is particularly significant considering food is upstream in the global commodity chain, and rising food prices may spill over to other commodities, further aggravating global inflation.While global food production systems remain vulnerable, China, with less than 9 percent of the world\'s arable land to produce about a quarter of world\'s grain and feed about a fifth of world\'s population, has contributed greatly to food security, and thus global stability and development at large.As the world\'s largest grain production and consumption country, China with its summer grain harvest has provided certainty in an increasingly uncertain world.China\'s grain output had remained above 650 million tonnes for eight consecutive years as of 2022, which to some extent helped suppress the rise of international grain prices.While many countries are suffering from severe inflation, China has seen mild inflation so far this year, with the average consumer price index from January to June increasing by just 0.7 percent. It has boosted the country\'s confidence in responding to various risks and challenges.China\'s bumper harvest can be attributed to the authorities\' efforts to maintain food security. Chinese leaders have repeatedly stressed that ensuring food security is always a top priority for national development and people\'s well-being.Following the summer harvest, summer planting and management work are also steadily proceeding across China. Food in hand, peace in mind.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('The magic of Hunan - People\'s Daily Online', 'A chance encounter with a happy baby and his father at Mao Zedong Square.The first province we visited in China was Hunan. This was in late March. We had already spent a month roaming the districts of Beijing. It was still too cold for my bones, so I was happy to welcome a different climate, away from Beijing, which I believe has a fake sun; shining with rays but still freezing cold in winter. It was also the first time I had taken a high-speed train. The train effortlessly glided atop buildings from Beijing to Yueyang, and by the time we reached our destination, it was almost nightfall and had started drizzling. Each of us was given an umbrella before strolling to the Yueyang Tower. To this day, here in The Gambia, I have that little umbrella with me. We spent two days in Yueyang, two days in Changsha, and two days in Chenzhou. There, without waiting to visit any other provinces, I concluded that Hunan was the best province in China. I was not wrong. The food, the community, the hospitality, the scenery, the smiles… It was a heart-warming trip that stayed with me for the ensuing three months of my stay in China.Then, by design or fate, we were informed that we would be returning to Hunan for the China-Africa expo, our last activity before flying back home to our respective African countries. I had already developed a love for Beijing and didn’t know how to process that information. The only province that could make me leave Beijing that late in my stay was Hunan. I could have stayed but I had to experience Hunan again, especially Changsha, which is my favorite city. Hunan was our first visit outside Beijing and it was quite poetic that it was to be our last. For someone crazy about literature and putting together words, I do not miss “the last”, if that makes sense.This time, it wasn’t a high-speed train, but a plane. Fast, efficient and boring. High-speed train is miles more fun, especially if you have altitude issues. At Changsha, I found it better than I left it: clean, green and serene. The food tasted better and spicier. The people had become even more accommodating. The pride on their faces to see foreign visitors, the authenticity of their smile, the excitement of the kids, the generosity of the elderly people… If Beijing is the brain of China, Hunan is its heart; a heart beating with love.A group photo in front of the former residence of Chairman MaoThe March trip to Hunan saw us take a different route. We visited some incredible high-tech companies and nature reserves, including Broad Group, where I saw an 11-storey building made within 29 hours, Junshan Island, East Dongting Lake and the eco-friendly fishing village, Liuzhamen. This time, however, in Changsha, Shaoyang, Shaodong and Shaoshan, it was all elevators, hair, luggage, agriculture and Mao Zedong, different aspects of the province, with each holding a special place in its overall development and historical architecture.Our trips to Hunan had a unique characteristic: high-speed trains. On our first trip, we took it from Beijing to Yueyang and then from Changsha to Chenzhou. It was the same with the June trip. We boarded it to Shaoyang, the largest city by population in Hunan, historically known as Baoqing. There, we visited the Asia Fuji elevator company. Located within the Shaoyang economic zone, Asia Fuji prides itself on its design and production of different elevators. When I say different, I mean DIFFERENT. For the first time in my life, I saw an elevator with four doors, having been introduced to one with three doors earlier at the same company. I had never even seen that on television. It’s top-notch creativity. The elevators can even be personalized in design with color preference at the center.The next stop was a hair factory. Human hair, to be specific. Shaoyang Sun Group was established nearly two decades ago and has an incredible growth rate. The company has more than 1,000 employees with customers spread across the world, producing 10 million high-end human hair pieces annually. A stroll through the company offered me the chance to see how “human hair” is made, from raw material to packaging. The demand for artificial hair is strong, with women spending thousands of dollars on it. It’s a multi-million-dollar industry! When a woman spends that much on hair, she doesn’t joke around with it. She takes care of it like her life depends on it. Technically, her life does depend on it, as beauty is life. She doesn’t even give it away as gifts. But Hunan is generous, so we were all gifted a package. The visit ended with a beautification exercise. We continued by testing different hairs in wigs and other forms, including ones for men and, for a minute, there was unisex African beauty at Sun Group that had never been experienced before. We also had a stopover in Shaodong at Chunlong luggage and bag company. The focus, dedication and creativity used to make bags enthralled me. Medium and high-grade bags and smart luggage series are at the core of its production line. We later visited the mall and had a thrilling interaction with the locals.A group of African journalists pose in front of statue of Mao Zedong at the Memorial HallAfter attending the opening ceremony of the China-Africa expo, we headed to Shaoshan, the birthplace of Chairman Mao. It was a refreshing trip. We visited his former residence, the memorial hall and Mao Square, which houses a bronze statue of the late leader. The whole city has the Mao touch; interactive, kind and welcoming. Hundreds of young people filled the Square as we laid wreaths and paid our respects to the great man. You could not only see excitement in the kids, but also feel it. The atmosphere was euphoric. Shaoshan is a Mao city.A group photo with young people at Mao Zedong Square in ShaoshanOur last day saw us visit the China-Africa trade demonstration park. We strolled around African stalls, did some freestyle drumming, built networks and had tea with the locals. Hunan Daily was our last stop, where I reconnected with two staff members who had been with us throughout our first trip.I have written a lot about China in the last four months. I hope it was enough to present a different picture of the country. Someday, maybe soon, I’d love to go to Qufu of Shandong Province, the birthplace of Confucius and channel the Confucian wisdom to write a book befitting of my experience in China.A group photo with staff of Hunan Daily. Talibeh Hydara is assistant editor of The Standard Newspaper in The Gambia. He received training in journalism in Beijing as a fellow of the China International Press Communication Center (CIPCC) Programme.', 'Hunan', '2023-07-18', 'By Talibeh Hydara (People\'s Daily Online) 13:12, July 18, 2023', 'A chance encounter with a happy baby and his father at Mao Zedong Square.\nThe first province we vis', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045768.html');

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Opinion: U.S. should push itself harder on global debt relief - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- As G20 finance ministers gather in India, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she was \"eager\" to work with China on debt restructurings for poorer countries and would push hard for \"full and timely participation\" in pending debt restructurings.Working on debt relief is a welcoming step, but to ensure faster global debt relief, the United States should push nobody but itself harder.Here are the main reasons:One, China is not the largest lender to developing countries; the U.S.-led West is.Recent data from the National Treasury of Kenya showed that 46.3 percent of Kenya\'s debt is owed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), while Chinese entities hold 17.2 percent of the public external debt. In Sri Lanka, private creditors lead with 53.6 percent, followed by multilateral creditors with 20.6 percent, while Chinese entities hold 10.9 percent of the external debt. And contrary to western media reports, Chinese entities account for only one-third of Zambia\'s external debt, with two-thirds owed to Western donors and multilateral institutions. In summary, the U.S.-led West is the principal lender to developing countries.Two, it is the U.S.-led West, not China, who should be blamed for the debt distress of developing countries.Various factors, including the U.S. Federal Reserve\'s interest rate hikes, global commodity price cycles, economic structures of some developing nations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Ukraine crisis, have caused liquidity shortages and sovereign debt crises. For instance, the U.S. monetary policy shift from extreme looseness to rapid interest rate hikes in 2022 catalyzed debt problems in some developing countries.The U.S. dollar\'s dominance led to rounds of quantitative easing and lowered interest rates, flooding Africa and emerging markets with low-interest dollars. However, aggressive interest rate increases later caused a liquidity shortage, funding chain disruptions, currency depreciation, and a surge in sovereign debt.The global financial governance system, centered on the U.S. dollar and institutions like the IMF and the WB, puts developing countries at a disadvantage, limiting their representation in the institutions and subjecting them to high financing costs due to bias from major rating agencies favoring the United States and Western countries.As a result, developing nations experience rapid credit rating downgrades and increased debt servicing expenses during liquidity challenges. Hence, being the largest shareholder in the WB and the IMF, the United States needs to take more actions to address the debt issues or offer viable solutions.Three, China\'s contribution to debt relief exemplifies how a responsible major country meets its international obligations.Citing data from the WB, Professor Ding Yibing, dean of the School of Economics, at Jilin University, highlighted that since 2016, China, as a bilateral creditor, has been responsible for roughly 16 percent of global debt relief, surpassing the United States and the WB.China\'s debt reduction has already doubled the average reduction scale of the G7 countries, he added.\"Among G20 members, China has provided the largest debt relief overall,\" said Ding. \"However, China\'s proportion of debt to Africa as a whole is not high. Multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold the highest share of debt. Even without China\'s debt, these countries still face high debt pressure.\"When the G20 introduced the COVID-19 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) in 2020, China swiftly expressed its support. A Briefing Paper by Deborah Brautigam, director of the China Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, praised China\'s role as a responsible G20 stakeholder during the pandemic. Among the 46 countries participating in the DSSI, Chinese creditors accounted for 30 percent of all claims and contributed 63 percent of debt service suspensions.Understandably, debt suspension and relief should be a collective effort: multilateral, bilateral, and commercial. China\'s proposal of shared responsibility in debt relief is fair and reasonable since all parties involved are creditors. It is unjust for only one side to bear the burden of debt reduction while others are exempted from their responsibilities.Undeniably, to achieve faster and more effective global debt relief, the United States should take a proactive stance and push itself harder.By shouldering its fair share of responsibilities, the United States can play a pivotal role in easing the debt burden and fostering a more sustainable and resilient global economic recovery, from which, in Secretary Yellen\'s words, \"all of us benefit.\"', 'debt relief push harder itself should global Opinion countri', '2023-07-18', 'By Tian Dongdong (Xinhua) 13:24, July 18, 2023', 'BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- As G20 finance ministers gather in India, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045781.html');
INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Opinion: Despite shifts in terminology, Washington\'s strategy to contain China remains unchanged - People\'s Daily Online', 'BEIJING, July 17 (Xinhua) -- It\'s not surprising that Washington\'s economic approach to China has shifted from \"decoupling\" to \"de-risking\" or \"diversifying critical supply chains.\" The change in rhetoric is nothing new, just old wine in a new bottle.The intention of White House officials remains unchanged -- to contain China.Their actions betray their intention, as they continue, if not speed up, labeling trade and economic connections with China as \"risky,\" hindering regular technology exchanges with China, and pushing key industrial and supply chains out of the world\'s second-largest economy.Concerns about the resilience of global supply chains continue to mount after the COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. While there are reasonable concerns, Washington uses this mentality to generalize security risks and associate China with these so-called risks.The new political rhetoric \"implies that trade with China is inherently risky regardless of the domestic business and investment environment,\" former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt argued, adding that it was fair when Chinese officials said they see no meaningful difference between de-risking and decoupling.The \"de-risking\" campaign merely repackages Washington\'s containment strategy against China.While U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the United States is looking to \"de-risk\" and not \"decouple\" from China, his \"small yard and high fence\" strategy restricts technology exchanges to exclude China from critical supply chains, obstructs China\'s moving up in the industrial value chains and suppresses China\'s development.Its underlying impulse is a desire to maintain \"supremacy in the face of rising aspirations elsewhere.\"While the United States claims it won\'t decouple from China but instead \"de-risk,\" its efforts to hold China back have accelerated.In early May, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a legislative plan called the \"China Competition Act 2.0,\" which attempts to win the \"competition\" against China by restricting the flow of investment and technology to the country. On June 12, the U.S. Department of Commerce added 31 Chinese entities in aviation-related fields to an export control list.The current U.S. administration has not merely instituted new and more export controls on high-end semiconductors between China and the United States but also coerced its allies to follow suit.In such U.S.-led cliques as the so-called \"Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity,\" the \"Chip 4 Alliance,\" and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, Washington has established a \"parallel system\" of supply chain alliances that excludes China.Not surprisingly, Washington\'s \"de-risking\" strategy has aroused widespread alarm.Niall Ferguson, a Scottish-American historian, wrote that Europeans have their doubts. First, they see the Inflation Reduction Act as Biden\'s version of the \"America First\" agenda. Second, they know that Sullivan\'s high fence keeps them out of the artificial intelligence race. Third, they are concerned about the unintended consequences of what amounts to a U.S. policy of technological containment of China.Meanwhile, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report warned that \"the U.S. technology base -- foundational to national well-being and power -- is thoroughly enmeshed with China in a larger, globe-spanning technological web.\"\"Cutting many strands of this web to reweave them into new patterns will be daunting and dangerous,\" it added.From \"decoupling\" to \"de-risking\" or \"diversifying,\" no matter how the wording changes, the U.S. approach to China, governed by a Cold War mentality, remains unchanged.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said recently in her Beijing visit that she heard China\'s concern that \"de-risk\" amounts to \"decoupling,\" an issue that was \"extremely important\" for her to address.Actions speak louder than words.

After graduating from London University with a master\'s degree in Chinese Architecture, she joined the British Library in 1977 and served as the curator of the Chinese collections for more than 30 years, until retiring in 2013.One of her main duties in the role of curator was to purchase books in Chinese about China, covering various subjects including humanities and literature.\"It was a wonderful and rewarding job,\" she said. \"It was fascinating (while) watching China\'s expanding publications from the 1970s onwards.\"Wood wrote several books related to China, including on Qin Shi Huang -- the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty, Marco Polo and the Silk Road. Last month, Wood received a golden trophy from the 16th Special Book Award of China in Beijing for her contributions to promoting Chinese culture.\"It\'s certainly the first award that I have ever got in China ... It was extraordinary to go to a proper ceremony where we were handed our trophy,\" she said.Wood has been interested in Chinese history ever since her study at Peking University. She has a particular interest in the history of the Ming Dynasty, which she said is \"quite well-known to historians of China.\"\"People in the West know the name (of the Ming Dynasty). But that\'s it,\" she added. In her view, mutual understanding and learning among civilizations are becoming more and more important.\"Chinese culture is so rich and in a sense different ... I think it\'s terribly good for us to look at things (differently),\" she said, adding \"There are so many things that affect people all over the world equally, and we really do have to work together.\"To me, it has been so fascinating learning about China and continuing to learn about Chinese culture,\" she said.Wood\'s love for Chinese culture is reflected in her daily life. The front yard of her house is full of bamboo, and her bookshelf is loaded with Chinese and English books related to China. She keeps numerous gifts given by her Chinese friends, such as small Peking opera masks, inkstones, and Chinese calligraphy works and paintings.Referring to her recent role as a judge in the \"Chinese Bridge\" language contest held in London for British university students, she said she was amazed by their great enthusiasm in learning Mandarin.They were not only fluent Mandarin speakers but also excellent performers with talents such as musical instruments and martial arts, she said.\"People now have such a good chance to go to China, to visit and learn from people (in China). The chances are much greater than they were when I started learning,\" she said.She shared with Xinhua one of her favourite Chinese words -- \"Mao Tou Ying (in English owl)\" and explained: \"I love it because it immediately gives you a picture of an owl ... It looks like a cat because it stares straight at you. And it has little ears, but it has the beak of an eagle.\"Such kind of \"wonderful combination\" of Chinese characters offered her much pleasure, she said.

This summer, researchers of the institute are compiling chronicles for the temple, and delving into the fine elements of traditional culture epitomized in the temple.Across the country, historical and cultural heritage sites are protected and studied to discover and learn about traditional Chinese culture, amid the nation\'s efforts to build a modern Chinese civilization. In total, there are 5,058 major historical and cultural sites protected at the national level.\"The historical and cultural sites, bearing witness to the long history and splendid culture of the Chinese nation and carrying the genes of traditional Chinese culture, offer us rich \'spiritual nutrients\' in the midst of building a modern Chinese civilization,\" said Gao Jiangtao, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.Shanxi Province, taking a fairly large proportion of the 5,058 major historical and cultural sites protected at the national level, has endeavored to train more professionals for the protection of historical and cultural sites and to cultivate enthusiasm for the antiquities of the general public.TRAINING PROFESSIONALSIn Shanxi, local protection work has long been plagued by understaffing. A project was launched in 2022 to enroll a total of 600 students for a span of five years, specifically for 117 localities across the province in need of protection professionals.These students will be offered general education on relics protection during college, free of tuition, and are duty-bound to work for pre-designated employers after graduation.The 19-year-old Li Jingyi, who hails from Wanrong County, Yuncheng City of Shanxi Province, grew up watching the nearby Feiyun Tower, a wooden tower featuring characters of the Yuan (1206-1368) and Ming (1368-1644) dynasties, a historical and cultural site protected at the national level.Li, among the first batch of students joining the project, will receive training in archeology, cultural heritage architectures, and museum studies at Shanxi University and return home for work when she finishes college.\"Ancient architectures exude a beauty bestowed by history, I\'m fascinated with that, and I\'d love to work for the protection of cultural relics in my hometown,\" she said.CULTIVATING ENTHUSIASTSLocated on the outskirts of Taiyuan, capital of Shanxi, the tomb of Xu Xianxiu, a high-profile official of the Northern Qi Dynasty (550-557), is considered to have some of the best-preserved murals from the Northern Qi period. The interior walls of the tomb are decorated with paintings covering about 330 square meters.However, for the sake of preservation, watching the murals on-site is not possible. A museum featuring murals of the Northern Qi Dynasty was built in Taiyuan based on archeological discoveries of the tomb.Rather than \"sitting still,\" the museum reached out to school students with the help of metaverse technologies. Wearing Virtual Reality goggles, and holding hand-held controllers, students of Taiyuan No. 19 Middle School recently \"walked\" into the tomb to watch the murals. They were even able to \"lift\" an unearthed artifact for a close-up gaze.\"With the help of technologies, we are taking the cultural relics to schools, getting students acquainted with them so that they might fall in love with traditional culture,\" said Wang Jiang, curator of the museum.Ren Junhua, professor at the Party School of the Communist Party of China Central Committee (National Academy of Governance), said that modern Chinese civilization is deeply rooted in the fertile ground of traditional Chinese culture.Greater efforts are needed to study and interpret the traditional culture embedded in those cultural and historical sites, and to boost the popularity of those sites with technological means and likable presentation, Ren added.', 'Cultural sites historical tomb Province protected Shanxi tra', '2023-07-18', ' (Xinhua) 16:10, July 18, 2023', 'TAIYUAN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Across regions within the sphere of influence of Chinese culture, Guan', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045891.html');

By setting her air conditioner to 26 degrees Celsius and utilizing energy-saving modes on electrical appliances, her family managed to cut down 620 kg of carbon dioxide emissions from electricity consumption last year.The details are shown on an app on her mobile phone, which not only facilitates electricity bill payments but also displays information about her household\'s daily carbon emission reduction, cumulative carbon reduction, and her ranking among all users. Liu has even earned the title of \"carbon reduction expert\" on the app due to her eco-conscious choices.In Shenzhen, over a quarter of its power users, or around 805,000 households, have signed up for carbon accounts on the app, which was jointly launched by the Shenzhen municipal bureau of ecological environment, the Shenzhen power supply bureau under China Southern Power Grid and China Emissions Exchange (Shenzhen) in 2022.The platform has recorded a cumulative carbon emission reduction of about 12,000 tonnes, equivalent to approximately 4,516 tonnes of standard coal.Liu is part of a growing population in China participating in \"carbon inclusion,\" an incentive mechanism that values environmentally-friendly practices of the public, communities and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in daily consumption.Under this mechanism, the emission reduction generated by the low-carbon behavior of individuals and entities can be used to offset their own carbon emissions, participate in carbon trading or be converted into other more diversified incentives.Since China has set ambitious goals of peaking its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, the concept of green and low-carbon no longer solely applies to industrial emissions but encompasses various aspects of ordinary people\'s daily activities, such as consumption and transportation.According to a review report on the development and practice of China\'s carbon inclusion released in February, the establishment of carbon-inclusive platforms and personal carbon accounts is expected to promote the green and low-carbon transformation on the consumption side in China.Similar platforms have also emerged in many other cities. In Beijing, users of a WeChat mini program called \"green season of life\" can earn carbon credits by purchasing environmentally friendly household appliances and new energy vehicles and riding shared bicycles. These credits can be exchanged for rewards such as bike riding cards, movie vouchers, and parking coupons.Shanghai resident Han Yifan exchanged his six-month carbon emission reduction points for an \"exclusive green travel card,\" granting him three months of free rides on the city\'s buses, subways and ferries through the \"Suishenxing\" app.Major commercial banks in China are actively developing individual carbon accounts, providing personalized services based on customers\' carbon credit status.Private enterprises such as JD.com and Meituan are also actively involved in the green initiative. In the first half of this year, the Meituan app offered personal carbon accounts for approximately 40 million active users of its shared bicycle service.Experts believe that although individual contributions to carbon emission reduction may seem small, the collective actions of China\'s 1.4 billion population can have a significant impact.Looking ahead, it is essential to explore the integration of carbon-inclusive emission reductions into the national carbon market, which will facilitate a linkage between individual carbon accounts and the government, manufacturers and financial enterprises, said Chang Jiwen, a researcher on resources and environmental policies with the Development Research Center of the State Council.Chang added that this integration will transform individual carbon accounts into valuable green assets and establish an effective commercial model for carbon inclusion.', 'The reduction SHENZHEN accounts emissions users and individu', '2023-07-18', ' (Xinhua) 16:59, July 18, 2023', 'SHENZHEN, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Ms. Liu, living in Shenzhen of south China\'s Guangdong Province, has a', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 20:30:22', 'http://en.people.cn//n3/2023/0718/c90000-20045983.html');

Indian industries have developed thanks to China\'s supply chain.Despite political differences and border disputes, China has always promoted trade ties with India. It is China\'s vision and policy to maintain good relations with neighboring and regional countries, setting differences aside, and promoting trade, peace, and stability in the entire region as well as globally.However, in recent years, India has taken measures and introduced new laws that could harm Chinese investments and trade. These actions reflect negatively on its trade ties with China.Amid simmering geopolitical tensions, in April 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s government put restrictions on foreign investments from nations sharing a land border with India. Primarily aimed at China, the new rules stated that foreign investors from these nations would have to seek regulatory approval before investing in India or increasing their stakes in Indian companies.Under its updated Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy, India has approved some Chinese investment proposals. Yet, New Delhi remains cautious, reportedly approving only 80 out of 382 investment proposals from Chinese entities since the restrictions were introduced in April 2020.The FDI restriction is not the only measure enacted by New Delhi to create an unfriendly environment for Chinese investment in India. In April 2022, the Parliament of India passed the Chartered Accountants, the Cost and Works Accountants, and the Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill in what was seen as a further attempt to crack down on Chinese investment in India.It is worth noting that the amendment also means that investors from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh need to seek the Indian government\'s approval before proceeding with their FDI investment. Although, it is widely accepted that the policy was designed with the Chinese in mind.Unfortunately, India has also introduced policy measures to ban Chinese products. Xiaomi, a Chinese tech company whose products suit the Indian market, has seen rapidly growing demand. However, Xiaomi was falsely suspected of illegally transferring money to foreign entities in violation of India\'s Foreign Exchange Control Act. As a result, India seized about 4.8 billion yuan ($669 million) of assets belonging to Xiaomi.On July 10, Hon Hai Technology, known internationally as Foxconn, announced its withdrawal from a $19.5 billion semiconductor joint venture with Indian mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd. due to \"external issues unrelated to the project.\" This move was seen as a big blow to India, especially as a setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s ambitions to build a chipmaking industry.Several high-profile cases targeting Chinese companies and the withdrawal of Chinese investments in India have raised doubts about India’s investment climate.Due to several similar actions, India is called by some as \"a graveyard of foreign companies\" or a \"black hole of foreign investment.\"A Nepali friend informed me that India stopped importing electricity from Nepal based on the dubious excuse that this electricity is produced by Chinese investment in Nepal. This seems ridiculous!Due to India’s biased approach and anti-China policies, bilateral trade declined during the first half of this year. It is feared that if India maintains these restrictions and biased policies, it could further harm India-China trade. However, if China takes reciprocal measures, India may be unable to handle the consequences.Zamir Ahmed Awan is a non-resident fellow at the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) and a sinologist at the National University of Sciences and Technology in Pakistan.

(Xinhua/Zhang Xiaoyu)TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not endorse the Japanese government\'s decision with its safety review report on Japan\'s plan to release nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea, the report presented Tuesday here by the IAEA chief showed.\"I would like to emphasize that the release of the treated water stored at Fukushima Daiichi Power Station is a national decision by the Government of Japan and that this report is neither a recommendation nor an endorsement of that policy,\" the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi noted in the foreword of the report, which he delivered in person here on Tuesday to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.\"The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect those of IAEA Member States,\" said the report, noting that \"neither the IAEA nor its Member States assume any responsibility for consequences which may arise from its use.\"The Japanese government has been pushing to start dumping the contaminated water this summer, which has aroused strong opposition and doubts from domestic fishing groups, neighboring countries, Pacific coastal areas, South Pacific island countries, and the overall international community.Also on Tuesday, two South Korean media outlets said that Japan inked a \"black deal\" with the IAEA to \"redact\" the sensitive issues mentioned in its final report, citing anonymous informants.Obtained documents supported allegations that the Japanese government provided the IAEA with at least 1 million euros to earn a draft of the IAEA final report ahead of its official delivery and demanded it be redacted in sensitive parts, The Tamsa and The Mindlenews told a joint press conference with foreign correspondents.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday told a regular press briefing that China believes that the IAEA should come to a conclusion on the ocean discharge of contaminated water from Fukushima that is responsible and can stand up to the test of history and science, and must not endorse Japan\'s wrongdoings in the disposal of nuclear-contaminated water.On Tuesday afternoon, Grossi stressed at a press conference held at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo following the IAEA report delivery that the option to discharge the nuclear wastewater into the sea is one made by the Japanese government.The IAEA will have a continued presence at the Fukushima Daiichi plant site to review, monitor and assess the discharge activities for decades to come, Grossi said, adding that whether to allow other countries to participate in the supervision is a decision to be made by the Japanese government.During Grossi\'s press conference, a group of protestors gathered outside the Japan National Press Club to voice opposition to Japan\'s ocean discharge plan, shouting \"The sea belongs to mankind. Don\'t dump polluted water into the sea,\" and \"No discharge without consent. Keep your promise to the fishermen!\"At the invitation of Japan\'s foreign ministry, Grossi started his four-day visit to Japan on Tuesday, including a trip to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi (L) delivers safety review report on Japan\'s plan to release nuclear-contaminated water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the sea to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo, Japan, July 4, 2023.

(Photo/Ye Gongfu)Expanding market presence\"Previously expensive blueberries have become increasingly affordable,\" a citizen surnamed Li, who is in charge of buying food for his family of five, told People\'s Daily Overseas Edition.The price of blueberries has come down to 7.9 yuan ($1.09) per box (125 grams) in some shopping malls and supermarkets in China, Li said, adding that most of the products come from southwest China\'s Yunnan Province and are just as good as imported blueberries in terms of taste, size, and freshness.Besides blueberries, many other types of lesser-known fruits that were often imported from other countries, such as red grapes, mandarin oranges, cherries, kiwi fruit, mangoes, lychees, and dragon fruits, have also been successfully cultivated in many regions of China. This means longer supply periods and cheaper prices for Chinese consumers.With the industrialization of blueberry cultivation, the blueberry season can last from March to October in China, with the average price of the fruit being much lower than that of imported blueberries sold during November and February.Photo shows a farmer harvesting blueberries at a blueberry orchard in Sucun township, Yinan county, east China\'s Shandong Province, June 9, 2023. (Xinhua/Yin Jun)As China\'s fruit industry’s number of new varieties blooms and becomes higher in quality, domestic fruits are becoming an increasingly common sight at fruit markets across the country.\"One of our large retailers told us that about 10 years ago, 90 percent of the fruits they sold were imported, while the proportion of domestic fruits today has exceeded 30 percent and is increasing,\" said Liu Chengxin, general manager of Hainan Xiyuan Ecological Agriculture Co., Ltd. The company, based in south China\'s Hainan Province, specializes in the cultivation and sale of tropical and subtropical fruits. It has supplied many new types of high-quality homegrown fruits and vegetables to the domestic market in recent years.\"In fact, brand building and large-scale development was proposed and practiced in the domestic fruit industry seven or eight years ago. Since it takes time for an agricultural endeavor to yield fruits, consumers didn\'t enjoy the results of these efforts until recent years,\" Zhai Shujia, an executive of the agricultural technology and product incubation center of Alibaba\'s online community group buying platform, Taibao Maicai.More types of lesser-known fruitsChina\'s total fruit planting area grew to more than 12.8 million hectares in 2021, with the area of traditional fruits like apples and pears decreasing while that of lesser-known fruits, including cherries, kiwi fruit, and strawberries, continuing to rise, according to a report on the development of China\'s fruit industry in 2022 published by China Fruit Marketing Association.Recently, the news that the first batch of homegrown durians are about to ripen in Hainan has heartened Chinese consumers eager to enjoy domestic durians for the first time.Photo taken on June 6, 2023 shows a tourist picking cherries at an orchard in Duzhuang township, Haigang district, Qinhuangdao city, north China\'s Hebei Province. (Xinhua/Yang Shiyao)Hainan Xiyuan Ecological Agriculture Co.,. Ltd. has planted 1,300 mu (about 86.67 hectares) of Musang King durian in its plantation. The durian trees, which have begun to bear fruit, are expected to provide fresh Musang King durians for the Chinese market for the first time, as all Musang King durian imports from abroad have been frozen fruit so far.Data released by the International Blueberry Organization (IBO) showed that the global planting area of blueberries reached 235,400 hectares in 2021, and China, with a total blueberry planting area of nearly 70,000 hectares, has surpassed the U.S., Chile, and Peru to become the world\'s largest producer of blueberries.While blueberry is not a traditional fruit in China, it is now grown on a large scale in more than 20 provincial-level regions in China, thanks to surging consumer demand in the country.Upgraded post-harvest treatment and transportationChina is the largest producer of kiwi fruit in the world, according to the report on the development of China\'s fruit industry in 2022, which noted that China made up more than 50 percent of the global kiwi fruit supply in 2020. However, China is also the largest importer of kiwi fruit, according to the report.Due to the country\'s lack of advanced post-harvest preservation technology and means of transporting fresh fruit, China has been unable to ensure a sufficient supply of ready-to-eat kiwi fruit for the domestic market. As a result, it imports a large quantity of high-quality kiwi fruit from foreign countries every year.\"About three or four years ago, we noticed that imported ready-to-eat kiwi fruit sold very well in China, and there was no domestic fruit that could compete with it,\" said Zhai, who revealed that Alibaba\'s subsidiary that specializes in digital agriculture has been working together with outstanding kiwi fruit production areas to cultivate and promote homegrown ready-to-eat kiwi fruit over the past years.Their endeavor has paid off well. Zhai\'s team has made great achievements in the development of ripening technology for kiwi fruit and finally managed to make sure their ready-to-eat kiwi fruit provided for consumers are at the peak tasting period when they have just the right amount of firmness and sweetness.Shaanxi Lyuyilong Agriculture and Forestry Development Co., Ltd., a company based in Wugong county, northwest China\'s Shaanxi Province, operates 1,800 mu of kiwi fruit orchards. All the kiwi fruit produced by these orchards are ready for consumption as they enter the terminal market, which has been the largest change seen in the orchards in the recent couple of years.\"Ready-to-eat kiwi fruit guarantees a good consumer experience. Their supply still falls short of demand. We don\'t need to worry about sales as long as our quality is good,\" said Liu Xiaofeng, an executive of the company.Many industry insiders believe that China\'s massive consumer market\'s demand for the stable quality, continuous supply, and reasonable price of fruit is constantly driving the country\'s fruit industry toward large-scale and standardized development.

(Photo/Wen Xinghua)There\'s a 2,712 km railway in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. It crosses desert, the Gobi, and no man\'s land and stretches in scorching heat, sand storms and extreme coldness. It connects multiple places in five prefectures in southern Xinjiang and serves millions of people of various ethnic groups. Because of it, many remote cities have had access to railway services for the first time.It is the rail loop line that encircles the Taklamakan, China\'s largest desert. As the world\'s first desert rail loop line, the railway was completed after the new Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line was linked with the Ruoqiang-Korla section of the Golmud-Korla railway line, and the Korla-Kashgar and Kashgar-Hotan sections of the southern Xinjiang rail line in June last year.\"It was totally impossible to get cargos to Tibet in three days,\" said Huang Wei, general manager of a coal mining company in Xinjiang, adding that it took over 10 days before the Golmud-Korla railway line was put into service.Now, the loop line has further facilitated transportation, which helps broaden the sales channel of his products, the man added.The Golmud-Korla railway line is an important part of the loop line encircling the Taklamakan. It handles over 95 percent of the cargos in southern Xinjiang. From a line that connects Qinghai province and Tibet autonomous region, it has grown into a logistics artery that links Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and contributes to the economic development of west China.Today, carpets from Hotan, plums from Kashgar and apples from Aksu are being sent to various parts of China with a much faster speed.According to statistics, since the loop line was put into operation, freight transport centers in Korla and Kashgar have shipped nearly 33.5 million tons of cargos by the middle of this June.A train runs on the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. (Photo/Wen Xinghua)The loop line has for the first time brought railway services to Lop, Qira, Yutian, Minfeng, Qiemo and other places in southern Xinjiang, facilitating local residents of various ethnic groups.It is learned that the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line has witnessed more than 360,000 passenger trips in the past year, and trains were kept full almost every day.At around 1:00 pm, Train 5818 was about to depart from Hotan. Attendant Mihray Mesawur retracted a bridge plate after receiving the order of departure and closed the door of a car. As the train blew its whistle, buildings outside the window started moving backwards and were gradually replaced by desert.Mihray Mesawur was born in Qira county, Hotan. Before the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line was put into operation, the county had no access to railway.The woman said that she had to spend 2 hours on bus and then take the train to go to work in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.\"Now I can go to the city by taking Train 5818,\" she noted.Tursuntohti Aminniyaz told People\'s Daily that it was the first time for him to take a train. \"I\'m going to Urumqi first and then Savan county. I have relatives there who told me I could probably get a decent job there,\" he said.Photo shows the Yutian train station in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. (Photo/Wen Xinghua)When the train passed Yutian, it was all desert outside the windows. However, there were grass grids and a green corridor about tens of meters wide along the tracks. According to a railway worker, the greenery was designed to protect the railway from sandstorms.The grass grids cover an area of 50 million square meters along the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line, which is also lined with 7,600 hectares of artificial trees. This effectively protects the railway and improves the ecology on both sides of the railway.Train 5818 arrived at the Minfeng railway station at 4:58 pm. About 186 km of the 264 km section north from the station was located in desert. That\'s why passengers always feel there are fine sands in their mouths.The number of days with sandstorms exceeds 200 each year there, said Zhong Dingjun, a chief engineer in Kashgar, adding that the high roadbeds, long and high bridges, as well as high tunnels were all built to make way for sand in case it buries the tracks.Apart from manual inspection, big data technology is also applied to ensure the stable operation of the desert rail loop line. For example, with the help of track geometry cars, as well as vehicle-mounted circuit checkers that collects gauge width and height, targeted maintenance can be carried out.\"They can find out a variation as small as 5 mm in track height,\" said Zhong.The desert rail loop line is injecting vitality into the economic and social development in southern Xinjiang, carrying the aspiration of the people along its route for a better life.', 'XinJiang', '2023-07-05', 'By Jiang Yunlong, Li Ya\'nan (People\'s Daily) 13:45, July 05, 2023', 'A train runs on the Hotan-Ruoqiang rail line in northwest China\'s Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region.', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 19:44:28', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0705/c90000-20039939.html');

Yan Dongjie reports from Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan.The Tang family has lived in Taiping, a village in the Baihe River National Nature Reserve, Jiuzhaigou county, Sichuan province, for many generations. The villagers have lived alongside golden snub-nosed monkeys for centuries, enjoying a harmonious relationship with the animals and passing down many legends.\"It is said that in ancient times, when a hunter aimed his gun at a monkey, she reflexively grabbed her infant and turned her back to the hunter, as if to say, \'Don\'t shoot my child.\' This legend has been passed down, so local people have never hunted golden snub-nosed monkeys and the animals have settled in this area,\" Tang Yulin said. \"Every villager loves the monkeys. It\'s a tradition.\"Tang Yulin plays with some monkeys. CHINA DAILYTang observed the golden snub-nosed monkeys with his father and great-uncle, who worked in the reserve when he was a child. He believes that, much like humans, the monkeys experience various emotions, to which he is deeply attuned.He thinks that their calls indicate at least seven emotions: \"Pupu\" signals laughter; \"Jiajia\" indicates alarm; \"Aiai\" is a greeting; \"Guga\" shows fear; \"Wawa\" is flirtatious; \"Wuwu\" suggests happiness; and \"Wowo\" is the monkey version of shouting.\"Your photos haven\'t captured the monkeys\' beauty. Look how stunning they are,\" Tang told me, when I visited.During our conversation, his every word and every gesture reflected his love of the monkeys, as well as his desire for more people to understand and protect them.Golden monkey Yuli, who was named by Tang Yulin, sits on a branch. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYLong-term commitmentWhen the Baihe River National Nature Reserve was established in the 1960s, Tang\'s great-uncle was one of the first staff members to move there. He spent more than 20 years in the reserve, patrolling the mountains every day, keeping an eye on the monkeys\' health, preventing fires and protecting the environment.Influenced by his family, Tang\'s father also became a golden monkey expert and worked at the reserve for more than 20 years. Tang is the third generation of his family to work as a forest ranger in the reserve.He knows every type of plant and tree in the reserve, which has earned him the nickname \"the living map\".He said the reserve covers more than 16,000 hectares, while the most recent \"census\" showed that there were roughly 1,700 golden snub-nosed monkeys living there. They are divided into six communities, each of which is similar to a human village and consists of several families.Located in Jiuzhaigou county, the reserve overlaps significantly with the Giant Panda National Park, which was established in 2017 as a pilot program.\"There are many nationally protected wild animals in the reserve, such as black bears, antelopes, Tibetan gazelles and giant pandas,\" Tang said.\"There are also several species of birds under level one State protection, such as Chinese monals and golden eagles.\"The golden snub-nosed monkey gets its name from its upturned nose, and is divided into five species: the Sichuan golden monkey; the Yunnan golden monkey; the Guizhou golden monkey; the Nujiang golden monkey; and the Vietnamese golden monkey.The first three species on the list are unique to China.Golen monkey Tianye climbs a tree. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYOn May 22, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly released the Red List of China\'s Biodiversity: Vertebrate (2020), which downgraded the Sichuan golden monkey\'s status from \"vulnerable\" to \"near threatened\".The list shows that through the collective efforts of various protection zones in China, the number of Sichuan golden monkeys in the wild has risen from 14,000 in 2002 to about 25,000, while the population\'s distribution has expanded significantly, which illustrates the success of the conservation efforts.Tang said that the Baihe reserve has a humid climate and lush vegetation, which serves as a rich source of food for the monkeys, who mainly eat wild plants, fruit and vegetables. They consume tender tree leaves in spring, wild fruit in autumn and tree bark to survive the harsh winter.\"So, protecting the environment here is the best way to protect the Sichuan golden monkey. Fire prevention is a major focus,\" Tang said, noting that no fires have been reported at the Baihe reserve for more than 40 years.Two golden snub-nosed monkeys sit on a tree in Jiuzhaigou. TANG YULIN/FOR CHINA DAILYTightknit speciesTang said that the Sichuan golden monkey is a very tightknit species, and whenever they are attacked by enemies, they fight together.\"On several occasions, I have seen that when a golden eagle tried to catch a monkey, all the monkeys made screeching noises and kept jumping at it one after another to drive it away. Also, when a monkey is injured, others in the group will take care of it,\" he said.He recalled that when experts from China and the United States came to the reserve in 1996 to watch and study the monkeys, he helped them observe and record the animals\' behavior, gaining a slew of professional knowledge in the process.\"Our camp was located at an altitude of 2,500 meters, and the monkeys lived very close to us, about 300 to 400 meters away. We used binoculars to observe them. I saw that five monkeys were huddled together in the trees every day and did not move. Later, I discovered that the monkey in the middle was sick, and the others were protecting and taking care of him,\" he said.Tang said the realization that Sichuan golden monkeys are just like humans — showing emotions and protecting their companions — has deepened his fascination with the species.Today, the number of Sichuan golden monkeys in the reserve has doubled, compared with the 1980s. Tang said that in addition to protecting the animals, he is thinking about how he can use the reserve\'s unique natural resources to bring financial benefits to the local people.However, Mo Cheng, director of the Baihe River National Nature Reserve, struck a note of caution.\"We are very conflicted. The tourism resources here are very good, and we want to open up and bring benefits to the local people, but we are also reluctant to develop because we don\'t want to damage the plants and animals,\" he said.\"With the advance of science and technology, we can gradually achieve some reasonable development while ensuring the protection of the environment.

Photo: Chen Xia/GTThe development of China\'s artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining momentum despite increasingly fierce global competition and the US\' relentless push for \"tech decoupling,\" with domestic tech firms showcasing various breakthroughs in key technologies at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) which kicked off in Shanghai on Thursday.Business insiders and experts said China has a long way to go to achieve high-tech self-reliance but they expressed firm confidence in the country\'s capability of attaining the goal on the back of policy support, industrial and supply chain coordination and continuous opening-up.On Thursday, a multitude of people gathered to interact with the large language models which are the most popular attraction in this year\'s event. NetEase Youdao unveiled an interactive English language learning chatbot at the event, which allows speakers to practice spoken English with the AI model.Chinese tech firm Meituan launched the 4.0 version of its unmanned aircraft system at the event. Compared with the previous editions, it has longer delivery range and better performance operating in inclement weather environment.In terms of semiconductors, a number of domestic chip companies including Enflame, Vastai Technologies and Hexaflake unveiled their cutting-edge AI chips, which enable large language models to process vast amounts of data at lightning speed.\"Recently, we have surpassed US chip giant Nvidia\'s high-end chips in a single benchmark for image recognition on the international stage. This achievement is a result of a step-by-step process,\" a sales representative surnamed Wang from a startup AI company told the Global Times on Thursday.Compared with Nvidia, we follow a different technological path to enhance performance by optimizing algorithms and reducing computational load, Wang said.The process of achieving self-reliance in science and technology has helped Chinese high-tech enterprises to forge their core competitiveness, and enabled them to become an essential part in the global innovative industrial chain.According to 2022 Global AI Innovation Index Report released at the WAIC, China ranks second in Global AI Innovation Index for the third straight year in 2022, as it has been accelerating efforts in expanding its talent pool, building data infrastructure and making technological breakthroughs.Despite some Western media hyping about the conference having lost the shine among the US giants, this year\'s WAIC however saw the participation of a record number of companies, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Focused on high-tech sectors including large models, chips, robots, and intelligent driving, the global event attracted more than 400 exhibitors and over 50 outstanding startups, with more than 30 cutting-edge products debuted for the first time. The organizer also said that the exhibition area totaled more than 50,000 meters. The number for participating companies and the venue area are at their highest levels since 2018, when the annual event was inaugurated, according to Xinhua.While adhering to self-reliant innovation, China has been actively promoting scientific and technological sharing and exchanges, aiming to contribute to global sci-tech development for the benefit of all mankind.In a sign of sound exchanges between Chinese and US business communities despite the Biden administration\'s mounting \"decoupling\" pressure, a number of high-profile US multinationals including Google and Tesla also showcased their AI-powered products and services at the WAIC.In a video speech delivered to the opening ceremony of the event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk lauded China\'s advance in the field. \"I think, really, China is going to be great at anything it puts its mind into. That includes many different sectors - sectors of the economy, but also artificial intelligence,\" he said.Xiang Ligang, director general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times, \"It has become a consensus among the domestic tech industry that they will strive for achieving self-reliance in high technologies whatever measures the US take.\"While US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\'s visit to China following a visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Beijing sends a positive sign of stabilizing China-US relations, there is no sign of any relaxation in the US\' containment of China.On June 27, US media reported that the US Commerce Department will stop the shipments of AI chips made by Nvidia and other chip companies to customers in China as early as July. Amid the US pressure to cut China off from key chipmaking tools, the Netherlands last Friday announced new export controls on advanced semiconductor equipment.\"The US has abused export control measures, continues to mount crackdown on China\'s semiconductor sector and purposely decouple the global chip market. The US\' actions harm global free trade, while ignoring international trade rules and trample on fair competition principle,\" Shu Jueting, spokesperson for China\'s Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular press briefing on Thursday.The semiconductor industry is a typical example of global division and China is the world\'s largest semiconductor market whose chip sales account for around one-third of the global total, Shu said, noting that this is a result of win-win cooperation between Chinese enterprises and those from other countries.\"The US\' moves harm not only the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies but also the interests of many other countries and regions, and hinder global sci-tech exchanges and economic and trade cooperation,\" Shu said, noting that they will backfire.\"Over the past five years, I strongly felt growing demand for domestic replacements, strengthened coordination between upstream and downstream companies as well as growing importance the authorities and investors attached to the high-tech sector. I believe Chinese chips will be able to compete with those made in the US one day,\" Wang said.\"The US\' actions will eventually come back to haunt itself, as its relentless containment of China - one of the world\'s most vibrant markets and one of the major sources of US firms\' revenues - will hurt its own intellectual property prowess and its global competitiveness in cutting edge technologies,\" Xiang said.The US\' two-faced foreign policy of seeking macro-economic policy coordination with China to solve the US\' own financial and economic problems while retraining from win-win cooperation with China will not yield any result the US side wants, he said, noting that it\'s the best choice for the US to conduct trade and tech cooperation with China.', 'The startup chips semiconductor US enabled number technologi', '2023-07-07', ' (Global Times) 10:21, July 07, 2023', 'Vsitors experience artificial intelligence that detects and interprets human emotional signals at 2', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-07 10:40:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0707/c90000-20041026.html');

(Xinhua/Jiang Wenyao)The Nujiang River, cascading down from the Tanggula Mountains on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, carves its way through the majestic mountains of Yunnan where a magnificent canyon is formed. Nestled at the northernmost tip of the Nujiang River canyon is the village of Qiunatong, home to a unique library called \"Banshan Huayu\" (Half Hill Flower Talks). \"The aroma of books reminds me of the fragrance of flowers,\" said Gan Wenyong, the library owner.Qiunatong Village, Gan\'s hometown, was once entrenched in dire poverty. Due to financial constraints, he missed out on educational opportunities during his childhood. Instead, he spent his childhood doing farm works, herding cattle, collecting herbs, and feeding pigs. However, in 2006, Gan seized the chance to pursue education when the revised Compulsory Education Law abolished tuition and miscellaneous fees. At the age of 14, he began studying in the fourth grade, relying on donations to complete his schooling and was later admitted to a university.After finishing the college entrance exam, Gan returned to his hometown with a collection of books. The children in the village flocked to borrow books from him. His idea of starting a library began to take form. \"I never had the chance to read a book until I turned 14. I hope to make up for my childhood regret by making books available to the children in my hometown,\" Gan said.In 2016, while still a college student, Gan brought the books he had collected back to Qiunatong. Selling his family\'s two cows to gather funds, he converted an unused family lodge into the village\'s inaugural library, \"Banshan Huayu.\" Upon graduation, Gan embarked on legal aid work in Gongshan County where Qiunatong Village is located. By the end of 2019, Gongshan County shook off poverty, and a year later, Gan was granted a loan to expand the library. With the support of the local government and charity groups, the library now has a collection of more than 40,000 books, attracting local villagers, especially youngsters.As the summer holiday approaches, a collaborative public welfare project between the library and Shenzhen University will be launched. Volunteers from Shenzhen University will start a free reading camp at the library for children in Qiunatong Village.Gan Wenyong now has a bigger vision.

(Xinhua/Tang Yi)CHONGQING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Guangyang Isle, the most extensive green island in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has been turned into an ecological restoration and protection \"classroom\" for ecotourists and school children.On July 3, a group of children and their parents from 15 families experienced a novel cultural study tour on the isle, located in southwest China\'s Chongqing Municipality. The theme of the tour was the \"summer phenology\" of the isle, meaning its natural and agricultural features during summer.During the half-day event, the students walked among the terraced paddy fields and an orchard, picking up plums and observing how the fields were farmed. They learned about the interactions between humans and nature, particularly the importance of protecting the ecological environment.Some of the children pointed excitedly at some ducks swimming in the paddy fields, and Wu Hongkun, the teacher leading the tour, stopped to explain the benefits that ducks can bring to crop yields.\"Our goal is to take these students out of the traditional classes to learn more about nature. Guangyang Isle is an ideal place to put this concept into practice,\" said Wu. \"For each month of the year, we can set up different themed study tours for children based on 24 solar terms, seasonal harvests and so on.\"Children learn to identify plants during an ecological education tour on Guangyang Isle in southwest China\'s Chongqing, July 3, 2023.

(CNSA/Handout via Xinhua)BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have studied the lunar samples brought back by the Chang\'e-5 mission and found surges in volcanic activity on the moon about two billion years ago, offering a window into the moon\'s late-stage evolution.The study, conducted mainly by a research team at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was published recently in the journal of Nature Communications.At the end of 2020, China\'s Chang\'e-5 mission retrieved samples from the moon weighing about 1,731 grams, which were the first lunar samples in the world in over 40 years.In the subsequent research, Chinese scientists dated the youngest rock on the moon at around 2 billion years in age, meaning that the period of lunar volcanism was between 800 and 900 million years longer than previously believed.\"This study further answered the question of how much magma spewed out during the moon\'s late period,\" said Tian Hengci, corresponding author of the study, told the China Science Daily.He added that the formation age of basalt, its geochemical characteristics and cooling timescales are critical to understanding the scale of a lunar magma eruption.Based on previous work, the research team found that the Chang\'e-5 basalt is likely to be the result of volcanic eruption during the same period, and as it came mostly from the same source, it provides an excellent opportunity to determine the thickness of the basalt lava flow and the scale of the eruption.Tian said that the cooling rate of magma is fastest at the surface, and it decreases gradually towards the interior. The cooling time and rate of magma can be deduced from changes in certain characteristic elements in minerals in the lunar samples, and based on this, the thickness of the lava flow and the scale of the eruption can be inferred.Researchers analyzed 21 olivine grains from basalt clasts, and the results indicate that the cooling time of most olivine particles was less than one year. Using a thermodynamic model, they estimated that the thickness of the basaltic lava flow was between 10 and 30 meters.Based on flat landing area of the Chang\'e-5, the research team extrapolated the volume of the basalt eruptions, and this indicated that there were large-scale magma eruptions on the moon about 2 billion years ago. The conclusions are consistent with the results obtained by remote sensing methods.According to the study, while the overall intensity of lunar volcanic activity may have decreased over time, there may have been episodic eruptions in the moon\'s late-stage with above-average flux.Researchers said that the reasons for the large-scale volcanic eruptions found during the late period of the moon are still unclear, and they will work with other teams to establish a thermal evolution model of the landing area to explore the mystery.', 'lunar magma samples volcanic scientists cooling eruptions mo', '2023-07-08', ' (Xinhua) 10:03, July 08, 2023', 'Photo provided by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) shows Chang\'e-5 probe gathering sa', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 10:47:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0708/c90000-20041418.html');

The Icebreaker Mission paved the way for the 1954 trade mission to China by 48 businessmen from British companies, which later became known generically as the 48 Group.\"The more time goes by, the more one can see how far-sighted the original icebreakers were,\" Bennett said. \"When there are people of vision and courage, you can make progress even in the most difficult times.

According to its curator, Angela Tecce, the exhibition began in Italy, the end point of the ancient Silk Road. It has toured several countries and regions along the route, including Trkiye and Uzbekistan, and finally landed in China\'s Xi\'an, the starting point of the Silk Road.The exhibition\'s tour to China can be read as a message of renewal and a fresh beginning, in which art confirms itself as a true facilitator for dialogue, said Pasquale Terracciano, director general for public and cultural diplomacy at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, in a preface to the display.The cultural communication between China and Italy can be traced back to ancient times. In the Western Han Dynasty (202 B.C.-25 A.D.), Chinese envoy Zhang Qian began his journey to the West via Central Asia, and opened up a trade route that later became the Silk Road.Originally a setting for commercial exchange, it evolved into a crossroads of different cultures. More than 700 years ago, the Italian merchant and explorer Marco Polo traveled to China on the ancient Silk Road. Chinese culture had spread to the Italian Peninsula through the trade of silk, tea and porcelain, and Roman architecture and art had also spread to China.In recent years, the Xi\'an Art Museum has been working closely with its peers in Italy. In 2018, it held the exhibition \"Beyond the Wall: Xi\'an Contemporary Art Exhibition\" in Florence, Italy, and it was well-received by locals.Both China and Italy boast long histories. Since visual art needs no translation, the exhibition can serve as a carrier for direct dialogue between classical and contemporary art, and between East and West, said Yang Chao, curator of the Xi\'an Art Museum.A total of 31 art pieces from 33 emerging Italian artists and established masters were on display at the exhibition. The artists utilized a variety of creative methods to manifest Italy\'s latest artistic developments, from the 1960s to the present day. Exhibits ranged from paintings and photography to sculpture and installation.One of the artworks, \"What holds it all together,\" drew many visitors. Made from porcelain and organic glass, it was inspired by the porcelain from the royal palace of Naples, demonstrating the then-popular artistic genre known as chinoiserie.\"The touring exhibition was vital to cultural exchange and the formation of consensus between the peoples of China and Italy in today\'s turbulent world,\" Yang said.A visitor takes photos of an exhibit during an Italian contemporary art exhibition \"Italian Contemporary Art and Artists on the Silk Road\" at the Xi\'an Art Museum in Xi\'an, capital of northwest China\'s Shaanxi province, July 4, 2023.(Xinhua/Zhang Sijie)Visitors view exhibits during an Italian contemporary art exhibition \"Italian Contemporary Art and Artists on the Silk Road\" at the Xi\'an Art Museum in Xi\'an, capital of northwest China\'s Shaanxi province, July 4, 2023.(Xinhua/Zhang Sijie)Visitors view exhibits during an Italian contemporary art exhibition \"Italian Contemporary Art and Artists on the Silk Road\" at the Xi\'an Art Museum in Xi\'an, capital of northwest China\'s Shaanxi province, July 7, 2023.(Xinhua/Zhao Yingbo)', 'Xian Italian contemporary Silk Artists northwest province Ch', '2023-07-10', ' (Xinhua) 09:19, July 10, 2023', 'This photo taken on July 7, 2023 shows an artwork exhibited at an Italian contemporary art exhibiti', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041689.html');

It\'s cool inside on hot summer days even without the air conditioning on.Photo shows the service center of a residential complex for talents in Jiangbei New Area, Nanjing, east China\'s Jiangsu province. (People\'s Daily Online/Wu Jun)The \"wooden house\" is the service center of a residential complex for talents working in the city. The biggest highlight of the structure is that it is self-sufficient in energy.Zhu Kan, deputy director of the green architecture center of Nanjing Yangtze River Urban Architectural Design Co., Ltd., the designer of the \"wooden house,\" told People\'s Daily that the structure features ultra-low energy consumption.It was built with thermal-insulation wood materials and in the wall cavity, there are fire- and heat-resistant stone wool boards that keep the structure cool in the summer and warm in the winter, Zhu said.According to estimation, energy demand of the service center is only about 70 percent of that of similar buildings, which means that the structure can save 316,000 kWh of electricity and 1,600 tons of water on an annual basis, equivalent to reducing 274.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.Apart from saving energy, the service center is also a supplier of energy. The 864 solar panels which span 1,800 square meters on the top of the building make a micro grid that boasts a total installed capacity of 345 kW and an annual generation capacity of 270,000 kWh. The micro grid powers not only the building itself, but also the charging poles in the residential complex. The clean electricity generated by the facility each year is able to charge more than 5,000 electric vehicles.\"It\'s a prefabricated building, and the construction of it was like building blocks. Parts needed were fabricated in factories and then transported to the site for assembly,\" said Zhu, adding that it was efficient and reduced environmental pollution.A citizen rides a shared electric bike in Lianyungang, east China\'s Jiangsu province.

Passengers always complained about it,\" said Chen, referring to a 5-kilometer section that crosses 10 intersections in the downtown.However, things have changed since last September. Chen found that he was seeing more green lights and less red ones when driving through the section, and the cycle length of red lights became shorter.The change came from Wuxi\'s innovative attempt to promote green transportation and public transit with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.Chen\'s bus is powered by new energy and looks very tech-ish. On the top of it there are two antennas, which help realize precise positioning of the vehicle with the differential positioning technology. Besides, the bus is also equipped with a smart gateway that transmits real-time data of the vehicle, including speed, mileage and positioning information.A technician checks the production of a full-automated production line in a factory of a construction materials company in Taicang, east China\'s Jiangsu province.

After the platform received the consignor\'s demand, it checked the length, load capacity, compartment type and other information of trucks available at that time to see whether they were capable of shipping auto parts. It then made matching and recommendations based on truck drivers\' experiences and the consignor\'s preference.Thanks to the application of big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and other technologies, it takes just minutes to match a truck driver with a consignor on Yunmanman.As a homegrown firm in Nanjing, Yunmanman has extended its services to more than 300 cities and connected over 100,000 logistics routes. By reducing empty miles of trucks, the platform makes the logistics industry more efficient and cuts energy consumption and carbon emission, gaining both economic and social benefits.Benefiting from sci-tech innovation funds, office rental assistance and other favorable policies, Yunmanman has attracted more talents and upgraded its technologies, Wang told People\'s Daily.This year, the R&D team of the firm, making innovations in both business models and technological development, has realized minute-level matchmaking. It has improved the informatization and efficiency of the freight logistics sector and lowered the sector\'s general cost and rate of empty miles, Wang added.\"Software and information technology services is a main battlefield for the innovation of a new generation of information technologies, as well as a core engine driving digital economy,\" said an official with Nanjing\'s municipal bureau of industry and information technology.Cargo ships navigate on the Nanjing section of the Yangtze River, east China\'s Jiangsu province, July 4, 2023. (People\'s Daily Online/Fang Dongxu)As a renowned hub of the software industry, Nanjing is part of a national-level advanced manufacturing cluster for software and information technology services, witnessing robust growth in the industry, the official added. In the first quarter of this year, the revenue of software businesses in the city grew 13.6 percent to 175.84 billion yuan ($24.31 billion).Currently, leading enterprises are driving the development of the whole industrial chain in Nanjing, which helps expand the coverage of application fields and enhance the cluster effect, the official said.Recently, an automobile manufacturer in Jiangning district of Nanjing kicked off digital transformation by introducing a digital platform that helps promote interdisciplinary research and development from Nanjing-based software company Glaway Soft.\"As industries develop, intelligent upgrading and digital transformation remains an important way for enterprises to boost high-quality development,\" said general manager Yu Dingfang of Glaway Soft.According to him, with the help of a series of policies, the company has developed some 20 industrial software products that cover the full life cycle of products to mobilize small- and medium-sized enterprises to achieve digital, auto, and intelligent upgrading.Nanjing has rolled off a series of supporting policies to build a better environment for the development of the software industry. So far, the market of the industry has reached 740.8 billion yuan in Nanjing, or 56.3 percent of Jiangsu province\'s total.The city is now home to about 4,000 major software enterprises and has built a cluster with national-level industrial parks as the core and supported by provincial-level software parks.', 'software,Jiangsu', '2023-07-10', 'By Yao Xueqing (People\'s Daily) 13:19, July 10, 2023', 'At 10:00 am, a new demand popped up on freight dispatching platform Yunmanman, asking to send a batc', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041922.html');

CHINA DAILYDriverless: Trials a solid foundation for commercial runA larger fleet of driverless taxis will soon be available for hire in the capital city as the Office of the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone has decided to launch the commercial operation of autonomous vehicles and expand their serviceable area.On Friday, authorities in Beijing made a policy decision to allow eligible companies to operate driverless taxis without safety supervisors on board and charge passengers for the rides, marking a definite step in commercialization of intelligent transportation.Self-driving taxis were rolled out on a trial basis in the capital in March following a series of road tests, which were conducted with safety supervisors on board.Chinese tech giant Baidu and autonomous mobility startup Pony.ai won permits back then to operate driverless taxis through their ride-hailing apps within a 60-square-kilometer area in Yizhuang, located in the southern suburbs of Beijing. The trial rides were free for passengers.Now, the Office of the Beijing High-Level Autonomous Driving Demonstration Zone plans to allow commercial operation of the driverless taxis in an area of 500 sq km. Interested companies are required to apply for commercial operation permits.According to the office, 116 self-driving taxis have been operating in Beijing on a trial basis for the past four months. They have completed over 1.5 million test trips, and the total length of the trips reached nearly 2 million km. More than 95 percent of passenger ratings have been favorable.All the preliminary tests and free trials have laid a solid foundation for the commercial launch of unmanned vehicles and provided a wealth of experience in unmanned demonstration applications, said Xu Hongwei, executive deputy director of the office.During the commercial run of driverless taxis, more attention will be paid to the assessment of service capabilities of autonomous mobility companies, with the focus being on reviewing three risk aspects — passenger safety, traffic conditions and autonomous driving functions, he said.At the same time, tailored daily supervision and emergency plans will be formulated for the unmanned commercial fleet to ensure that these vehicles run smoothly and safely on roads, he added.Dai Wanli, a 35-year-old Beijing resident, said she and her family took a ride in a driverless taxi in May at Shougang Park, one of the venues for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.\"We booked a ride using a mobile phone app and followed instructions to the closest stop to board a self-driving taxi. We scanned the code, the door opened on its own and we hopped in,\" Dai said, pointing out that it was a very smooth ride, unlike some manned taxis.\"My son absolutely loved the ride. We\'ve seen other special projects in the industrial park, but this one is by far the most impressive,\" she said, adding that they planned to book another ride soon.Last month, Xin Guobin, vice-minister of industry and information technology, said at a news conference that China has opened up a road network of more than 15,000 km to test intelligent vehicles, including taxis and buses, involving multiple self-driving scenarios such as autonomous valet parking and unmanned delivery.', 'taxis Driverless paid capital autonomous Office vehicles run', '2023-07-10', 'By Luo Wangshu (Chinadaily.com.cn) 14:01, July 10, 2023', 'Baidu and Pony.ai\'s autonomous driving vehicles test on the street in Yizhuang in Beijing\'s souther', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 17:55:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0710/c90000-20041972.html');

So far, the number of world heritage sites in China has grown to 56, including the Great Wall and the Summer Palace in Beijing, the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, northwest China\'s Gansu province, the Yungang Grottoes in north China\'s Shanxi province and Fujian Tulou, a type of Chinese rural dwellings of the Hakka people in the mountainous areas in southeast China\'s Fujian province that dates back to Song and Yuan dynasties.Photo shows the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, north China\'s Shanxi province. (People\'s Daily Online/Li Ying)Diversity of human civilizations not only defines the world, but also drives progress of mankind. Over 2,000 years ago, ancient Chinese came to realize that \"things are born to be different.\" The prosperity of civilization and human progress will not be possible without enhancing common ground and reserving differences. It is the interaction among different civilizations that promotes human progress and prosperity.The Yungang Grottoes is a great example of Chinese-foreign cultural communication. For instance, in its Cave 18, one of the five earliest excavated caves with huge Buddha images, there is a Buddha statue on the north wall featuring Caucasian appearance. However, there\'s no document proving the Yungang Grottoes\' excavation was joined by European artisans. This exactly mirrors the communication between China and foreign countries in ancient China.Besides, various decorative patterns of both Chinese and foreign features are seen in the caves of the Yungang Grottoes, and some columns there obviously carry the characteristics of foreign cultures, such as the Ionic order from ancient Greece as well as other classic orders from Persia and India.Inter-civilization interaction promotes technological exchanges. It has been influencing the world since ancient times.For instance, porcelains went from ancient China to the rest of the world, and the technologies for making porcelains are still upgrading today. High-tech porcelains made from rare earths, mixed with metallic element, or made with various firing techniques can be used in biomedical fields such as manufacturing artificial bones and joints.It is true with the case of rice planting, too. Rice Terraces in the southern mountainous and hilly areas of China was recognized as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System, and the country\'s hybrid rice technology is benefiting the mankind. So far, Chinese hybrid rice has been planted in 16 African countries, and is printed on banknotes of Madagascar.People visit an exhibition titled \"Tota Italia -- Origins of a Nation\" at the National Museum of China in Beijing, July 17, 2022. (People\'s Daily Online/Yang Sengyu)Over the recent years, more and more quality exhibitions of cultural relics have been introduced to China, which mirrors the open and broad vision of modern China.The just-ended Gandhara Heritage along the Silk Road: A Pakistan-China Joint Exhibition held at the Palace Museum, Beijing, attracted a large number of visitors. The Gandhara was a major transportation route on the ancient Silk Road. As an outcome of the collision among Greek, Persian and Indian civilizations, it reflected the creativity and vitality of mutual learning among the civilizations along the ancient Silk Road.Between 2016 and 2020, China hosted over 300 entry-exit exhibitions of cultural relics. The Treasures of China, East Meets West: The Maritime Silk Road during the 13th - 17th Centuries, and The Splendor of Asia: An Exhibition of Asian Civilizations that was jointly organized by 47 Asian countries as well as Egypt and Greece all demonstrated the mutual learning between China and other civilizations around the world, becoming a \"golden signature\" of Belt and Road cultural communication.The conservation of cultural heritage is a shared responsibility of all mankind. The 8.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal in 2015 damaged many cultural heritage sites in the country. Two years later, the Chinese government officially kicked off a foreign aid project to restore the quake-hit Nine-Storeyed Basantapur Palace complex in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. It was the first major foreign aid project for cultural heritage conservation launched by China in Nepal.A man takes pictures of a statue at the Gandhara Heritage along the Silk Road: A Pakistan-China Joint Exhibition held at the Palace Museum, Beijing, March 16, 2023. (People\'s Daily Online/Du Jianpo)Today, the cooperation on cultural heritage conservation has grown into an area that sees great potential in inter-civilization exchange and cooperation.The preservation and restoration of historical sites in Khiva, Uzbekistan, the first cultural heritage conservation project launched by China in Central Asia, was completed in 2019. The project gave the Chinese side an opportunity to study local culture, history and traditional techniques, and brought to Uzbekistan Chinese philosophies, techniques and experiences of cultural heritage protection.The excavation of the ruins of Nateshwar in the Vikrampura Ancient City, Bangladesh marked the first archeological collaboration between China and a country in the South Asia subcontinent. It has achieved remarkable results. Currently, the two countries are planning to build an archeological park on the site, so as to further explore the value of the ruins and bring more benefits to local communities.The cooperation on cultural heritage conservation, as long as it conforms to relevant international and local principles and respects the customs of countries and regions concerned, leads to win-win situations.Currently, China is cooperating with six Belt and Road countries on the conservation of 11 historical sites, up from one country and one historical site. It has also launched 33 joint archeological projects with 17 Belt and Road countries, which all received high evaluation from local governments and people.Today, protecting cultural heritage and promoting mutual learning among civilizations has gradually become a consensus shared by the international community. However, it is also important to see that the conflicts in human society and the changes of the nature would both damage cultural heritage. To pass cultural heritage down through generations remains a heavy task that calls for continuous efforts.Chinese people believe that one should value not only one\'s own culture, but also the cultures of others, and this will contribute to the flourishing of all cultures. It is expected that countries around the world could work together to better inherit fine traditional cultures and respect each other\'s culture while protecting the diversity of human civilizations, and pursue further development of their own cultures, so as to deepen international cultural exchange and cooperation.(Hang Kan is the head of the Yungang Grottoes Academy.)', 'civilization', '2023-07-11', 'By Hang Kan (People\'s Daily) 09:42, July 11, 2023', 'To protect cultural heritage and pass it down through generations is a shared responsibility of mank', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 09:17:23', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0711/c90000-20042383.html');

As of the end of May, China was home to nearly 6.36 million sets of charging facilities, up 77.5 percent year-on-year.New energy vehicles are assembled in an intelligent factory of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Zeekr in Ningbo, east China\'s Zhejiang province. (People\'s Daily Online/Hu Xuejun)\"Chinese NEV manufacturers are changing the competitive pattern of the global auto market, seeing an opportunity to reshape the industrial model and build world-class brands,\" said Gu Huinan, general manager of GAC Aion.In terms of both technology and market, Chinese NEVs have reached a new transition from quantity to quality, shifting their focus from expanding order sizes to gaining economies of scale, Gu added.Since 2012, Chinese NEV manufacturers have taken the opportunities in the automobile industry\'s transition toward electrification, intelligentization, and internet-connected development, promoting technological, product and market innovations to foster new growth drivers.As a result, a batch of core technologies has been developed, and the total NEV production has risen sharply from 20,000 units at the end of 2012 to 20 million units today.Like many emerging industries, the Chinese NEV sector also faced a series of major problems restricting its development in its early stage, such as immature technology, high production costs, an incomplete industrial chain and a market that was yet to be formed.The rapid growth of the sector couldn\'t have been achieved in such a short time of 11 years without China\'s institutional and market advantages, the efforts made by both the supply and demand sides, as well as the synergy between policy and market.\"Over recent years, relevant departments have rolled out some 70 policies to support the NEV industry, which helped build a complete and synergetic industrial system, fostered the world\'s largest auto consumption market, and enhanced win-win cooperation between the NEV sector and relevant industries, contributing China\'s wisdom to promote the electrification transformation of the global automobile industry,\" said Xin Guobin, vice minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.', 'NEV', '2023-07-11', 'By Wang Zheng (People\'s Daily) 10:22, July 11, 2023', 'China on July 3 hit the production milestone of 20 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) as a pure elec', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 09:17:22', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0711/c90000-20042416.html');

(Photo provided by Lin Yi\'nan)Since the 1880s, large batches of foreign expatriates moved to Fuzhou, southeast China\'s Fujian province. Many of them would spend the summer in Kuliang, or what\'s known as Guling in Mandarin, a popular place for summer vacation located on the outskirts of Fuzhou.There, they built villas, hospitals, tennis courts, swimming pools, postal offices and many other facilities, and established a deep bond with local residents.Recently, Kuliang welcomed many old friends from the United States attending the \"Bond with Kuliang: 2023 China-U.S. People-to-People Friendship Forum.\" Some of them spent their childhood in Kuliang with their parents, and some boast close relations with the Chinese small town through their families. Kuliang is like a bond that connects them with China.Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the forum. \"I was very glad to hear from members of the Kuliang Friends, and to know from your letter more touching stories about your connection with Kuliang,\" said Xi in the letter.In 1901, U.S. citizen Milton Gardner came to Fuzhou as an infant with his parents and stayed until his family moved back to the United States in 1911. Gardner had been longing for revisiting his childhood home, but had never been able to make his wish fulfilled before passing away.In 1992, Xi, who was then secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned about this touching story from an article titled \"Ah! Kuliang.\" He then invited Milton Gardner\'s widow, Elizabeth Gardner, to visit China, so as to help fulfill her husband\'s lasting wish.Since then, the Kuliang story has become well-known to many.An aerial view of Kuliang. (Photo/Lin Shuangwei)Lee Gardner, grandnephew of Milton Gardner, told People\'s Daily that his whole family is grateful to Xi for realizing the dream of a senior American, adding that the Kuliang story has touched many people in the United States.According to the man, who has visited Kuliang four times, his grandfather and father were both born in Kuliang, and the place was their homeland and also Lee\'s second hometown. He said the words of love are universal though in different languages.He showed to People\'s Daily a photo album kept by his family, which records the deep bond between the Gardners and Kuliang. He said the album is the most valuable treasure of his family and would be presented to the Chinese people as a gift this time he came to Kuliang.Gail Harris, who once lived in Kuliang as a child, said in Fuzhou dialect \"I\'m home\" as she once again set foot on the land of Kuliang for the forum.Her grandfather Harry Russell Caldwell was an expert on the ecological environment of Fujian province and compiled South China Birds, a book studying bird populations in Kuliang. It\'s one of the earliest modern scientific works recording China\'s bird species.Harris noted that Caldwell loved China and the Chinese people, and now his grandchildren have also fallen in love with this country, adding that she very much misses and loves the time she spent in China.Lee Garnder holds a photo album that records his family\'s bond with Kuliang. (People\'s Daily/Wang Yinxin)This time, Harris met her childhood friend Li Yiying. They sat down and exchanged slowly, word by word, in Fuzhou dialect. The two friends greeted each other, with hands clasped together.Harris said that she hopes the bond in Kuliang could be passed down from generation to generation, so that love and friendship will live on forever.Octogenarian Priscilla Brewster Gill came to attend the forum accompanied by her granddaughter Katy Barber, recalling the old streets and alleys she remembered from her childhood. China is the hometown where her heart belongs, Gill said.Gill was born in Fuzhou\'s Gutian. Her father Harold Brewster once ran a clinic in Kuliang and was the last foreign president of the current Fujian Medical University Union Hospital.Gill lived in China for 12 years and used to help her father take care of patients. She recalled her childhood when she fell down and got hurt, the local villagers would also help her with her wounds. She and the locals were like families, Gill said.Elyn MacInnis, 72, is a senior advisor of the Kuliang tourism and culture research association. Her husband Peter MacInnis was born in Fuzhou, and her father-in-law Donald MacInnis was once a member of the Flying Tigers, a group of volunteer American pilots who came to China and stood shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people to fight the Japanese invasion.Elyn MacInnis and her daughter use a bucket to draw water from a century-old well in Kuliang. (Photo/Weng Rongfei)Over the years, the woman has been committed to spreading the Kuliang story.In 2016, she set up an English website about Kuliang and its history and established the group \"Kuliang Friends\" in the United States. Today, the group has over 50 members and has grown into an important force driving non-governmental friendly exchanges between China and the United States.Amity between the people holds the key to sound state-to-state relations. The Kuliang story is a great example of the people-to-people friendship between China and the United States.Although the two countries are currently facing difficulties and challenges in their relations, they are in dire need of enhancing people-to-people exchanges.Elyn MacInnis told People\'s Daily that their elder generations lived in Kuliang in the past and got along well with the locals, and this piece of history just well presents the good qualities of mankind - understanding, respect, peace, friendship and love.She noted that the Kuliang story belongs to not only China and the United States, but also the whole humanity at large.

(Xinhua/Zhang Nan)A rare scene in the past, this is now a common sight at the FAW Jiefang J7 complete-vehicle smart factory in Changchun City, northeast China\'s Jilin Province.The construction of the First Automotive Works, China\'s first automotive manufacturing plant and predecessor of FAW Group Co., Ltd., was launched in Changchun on July 15, 1953, marking the beginning of the nation\'s auto industry.From its first car rolling off the production line to being one of the world\'s top 500 companies, the FAW has become the epitome of China\'s auto industry development.Showing resilience and a strong momentum of rapid development, China\'s auto production and sales have ranked first in the world for 14 consecutive years, and those of new energy vehicles (NEVs) topped the global market for the eighth year in a row.Particularly, China\'s vehicle exports soared to around 1.07 million units in the first quarter of 2023, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, indicating that China had become the world\'s largest auto exporter in the period, outpacing Japan.INTELLIGENT AND DIGITAL EMPOWERMENTBy the end of 2022, the FAW had produced and sold more than 54 million vehicles and achieved an operating revenue of over 7.9 trillion yuan (about 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars), an achievement that 92-year-old Dou Shuxiang, who retired from FAW, had never imagined.When the FAW was first established, the workers used hammers to make doors, roofs, and wheels as they had no relevant information or experience.\"To build a car, we must build the car body first. We had a very tight schedule then and didn\'t even have time for drawing car blueprints or making molds,\" said Dou, recalling the unfavorable conditions.This file photo taken in August, 1958 shows China\'s first high-end passenger car, Hongqi, in Changchun, northeast China\'s Jilin Province. (Xinhua)In 1958, FAW established China\'s iconic car brand Hongqi, meaning \"red flag.\" The brand has been used as the vehicle for parades at national celebrations.FAW\'s success has stimulated the growth of China\'s auto industry. Over the past 70 years, the country\'s auto industry has gone from manual manufacturing to mechanical manufacturing, and now it\'s moving forward to intelligent manufacturing.At FAW\'s final assembly factory, an intelligent digital platform, which can detect problems with equipment connected to it, has reduced labor and improved efficiency.\"It is not only a manufacturing factory but also a digital platform,\" said Xiu Junyi, an executive with Hongqi manufacturing center, adding that through big data technology, every detail in the factory can be \"moved\" to the digital twin factory, which will provide support for R&D and innovation.In recent years, China has been actively promoting digital technologies to empower the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing industries, among which the automobile industry has become the epitome.At an automobile final assembly factory of Chinese automaker Geely Auto Group in Guizhou Province, equipment controlled by digital systems provides accurate and orderly assembly of parts prepared in advance.\"With the help of intelligent systems, the parts information needed for automobile assembly will be sent to the corresponding equipment suppliers, and they will prepare the required parts in advance,\" said Yang Mi, director of the assembly factory in the provincial capital Guiyang.Every car that requires final assembly has an identification system to ensure that the parts needed will not be mismatched, thus realizing lean production, according to Yang.Traditional car manufacturers must go through a digital and intelligent transformation, said She Shangfeng, vice president of Hebei-based Great Wall Motor Co., Ltd.REMARKABLE NEV DEVELOPMENTChina, the largest NEV market in the world, has witnessed significant development in recent years, as the number of competitors and sales of NEVs spiked, and consumers shifted their attention to hundreds of models offered in a wide range of prices.This photo taken on July 3, 2023 shows China\'s 20 millionth new energy vehicle (NEV) produced by GAC Aion New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. in Guangzhou, south China\'s Guangdong Province. (Xinhua/Deng Hua)On July 3, China\'s 20 millionth NEV rolled off the production line in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, creating a remarkable milestone for the country\'s NEV sector.With this record, the NEV sector has entered a new stage of large-scale, globalized and high-quality development, and is becoming an important part of China\'s modern industrial system, according to Fu Bingfeng, executive vice-president and secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).As the auto industry is going through a transformation of unprecedented magnitude, traditional automakers are also revving up their NEV production.In the battery development department of the new energy development institute of the FAW, the staff members are stepping up research and development of new battery technologies.The automaker aims to launch 15 Hongqi NEV intelligent products in the next three years and increase its accumulated NEV production and sales to 1.45 million units by 2025.Global automakers are also accelerating expansion efforts for the NEV sector in China. In late May, Volkswagen inked an investment agreement to build an R&D, innovation, and procurement center for fully connected electric cars in Hefei, capital of Anhui Province.

As Hollywood actors took to the picket lines outside major studios Friday morning, two of Hollywood\'s most powerful labor unions are striking simultaneously for the first time over 60 years. (Xinhua)LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- As Hollywood actors took to the picket lines outside major studios Friday morning, two of Hollywood\'s most powerful labor unions are striking simultaneously for the first time over 60 years.To the echoes of \"One day longer, one day stronger,\" being chanted on the strikers\' picket lines, 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) went on strike on Thursday at midnight, joining the 11,000 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) who have been on strike since May.\"We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories,\" said SAG-AFTRA in a public letter signed by many of the most famous names in Hollywood.The SAG-AFTRA strike, supported by thousands of Hollywood stars and other actors, came after negotiations for a new contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), the entity that represents major studios and streamers including Amazon, Apple, Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, and Warner Bros Discovery, broke down.In the last dual strike in 1960, it was Ronald Reagan, as president of the Screen Actors Guild (and future president of the United States of America), who led the labor walkout.The latest labor action has industry creatives going head-to-head with the \"Big 5\" Hollywood studios as well as big-money streamers and brought the 134-billion-U.S.-dollar American entertainment industry to a grinding standstill while their differences are ironed out and imbalances addressed.The strike comes at a challenging time for the entertainment industry, which is still grappling with the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid technological advancements. Streaming services have disrupted traditional revenue models, while the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) poses both opportunities and threats to creative professionals.On one side, the actors and writers are seeking improvements in compensation, better benefits, and safeguards against the growing use of AI in the industry.Actors also want greater transparency from giant streamers so they can share fairly in the revenues generated from their work. Streamers do not share any metrics of their audience viewership and project sales revenues even with the creators of those works. SAG-AFTRA wants to bring in neutral third parties to perform analytics to help determine fair payments to actors.These issues reflect the industry\'s changing landscape, including the meteoric rise of streaming services, and the potential impact of AI on the creative professions.On the other hand, studio executives argue that increased spending on content creation to meet consumer demand has negatively impacted profits, leading to job cuts. The AMPTP asserts that it has offered historic contract improvements, including increased pay and residual payments for certain shows streaming overseas. The studios maintain that they are committed to reaching a deal and getting the industry back to work.\"A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life,\" said the AMPTP on Twitter. \"The Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\"The ongoing WGA strike, which began in May, has already caused significant disruptions in Hollywood, with many TV shows and movies having to cancel or delay production.However, the actors\' strike will have an even more profound impact. In the realm of public opinion, it will certainly make an impact to see many famous actors joining the strike effort, including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Eva Longoria and Glenn Close.TV series will be forced to an indefinite hiatus, and movie theaters, already struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and changing viewing habits, will face another major financial challenge, when movies that have already been shot are unable to be released.Both writers and actors are prohibited from promoting their projects during the strike. This restriction means no premiers, talk, show appearances or magazine cover stories that haven\'t already been scheduled.The strikes will also impact industry events, such as San Diego Comic-con for actors, where writers and directors usually interact with fans and promote their work. Award shows like the Emmys and potentially the Oscars may be delayed if the strikes continue into 2024.Only animation (not including voice actors) reality shows and projects shooting outside the United States with non-SAG actors can continue during the strike.The hope is that negotiations will resume soon and lead to a resolution before the strikes become prolonged.However, if the strikes continue, the consequences for the industry and the economy will be substantial, affecting not only workers directly, but also support services and regional economies dependent on the entertainment business, such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and Atlanta.\"If they don\'t resolve these things and it drags out, it\'s going to be a disaster,\" A-list Hollywood producer Arthur Sarkissian told Xinhua.The 2007 writers\' strike lasted 14 weeks and caused significant economic distress to the entire entertainment industry.Many actors and writers blame much of the current loggerheads on the bloated executive salaries at streamers and studios, which can be tens of millions per year to each executive. They suggest reducing executive salaries to give fair wages to the creatives who generate the material that makes Hollywood the leading content-provider in the world.\"We\'re all in it together. Without the writers and actors, they have nothing. And without the studios and distributors, the others have nothing. It\'s gotta be a win-win,\" Sarkissian added. Members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) demonstrate in Hollywood, Los Angeles, the United States, on July 14, 2023.

(Photo by Zhou Dongchao/People\'s Daily Online)The Yangtze River Delta region in east China, one of the country\'s economic hubs, boasts high economic vitality, high-level opening up and strong innovation capability. It holds nearly 1/3 of China\'s valid patents and a quarter of the country\'s valid registered trademarks.The region enjoys full-chain circulation of intellectual property rights (IPR) factors, which contributes to its high-quality development.So far, the region has nurtured over 1,800 demonstration enterprises with intellectual property advantages, which drive the comprehensive improvement of the region\'s industrial competitiveness. Centering on integrated circuits, biomedicine, artificial intelligence and other key areas, the region established seven industrial IPR operation centers and 24 national-level patent navigation service bases to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies.Last year, the amount of patent pledge financing in the region jumped 72.6 percent year on year to 186.26 billion yuan ($26.05 billion), accounting for nearly half of China\'s total. Besides, the region is also home to 29 national-level IPR protection centers and fast-response IPR service centers, as well as over 400 mediation organizations for IPR disputes.Focusing on improving mechanisms, smoothening the flow of factors, strengthening protection, optimizing services and deepening reforms, the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) is promoting the high-quality integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta with IPR improvement, said Liang Xinxin, spokesperson of the CNIPA.The three provinces and Shanghai municipality in the Yangtze River Delta region have established complete cooperation mechanisms and made a lot of explorations in strengthening IPR protection, optimizing the business environment and serving market entities, Liang added.Over recent years, a series of new mechanisms and models related to IPR have been piloted in the region, and achieved positive results.In Jun 2021, China\'s newly amended Patent Law entered into effect, which has added stipulations on a new patent open licensing system. According to the law, after a patentee declares to the patent administrative department to grant an open license and specify the royalty, anyone can exploit the patent in accordance with conditions during the implementation period of the open license.In May 2022, Shanghai took the lead to pilot the open license. \"Open license has built a bridge for universities, research institutions and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to transfer and commercialize their achievements,\" said Rui Wenbiao, head of Shanghai Intellectual Property Administration.According to Rui, 50 enterprises and institutions in Shanghai have opened 240 patents, and 58 of them are free of charge. The city has introduced 610 patents opened by patentees outside of Shanghai, including Tsinghua University. Shanghai Jiao Tong University has reached a 10-million-yuan deal of an open license with an enterprise, Rui said.A minimally invasive surgical robot is exhibited at the 9th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair in east China\'s Shanghai, June 15, 2023. (Photo by Zhou Dongchao/People\'s Daily Online)The mechanism of the patent open license is just a miniature of the institutional innovation made by the Yangtze River Delta in IPR.In April 2023, Hefei of Anhui province issued the first intellectual property securitization for SMEs that feature specialization, refinement, uniqueness and innovation in the region, with a scale of 123.5 million yuan.Zhejiang province, which is adjacent to Anhui, took the lead in undertaking a pilot reform of the data IPR. It has launched China\'s first public deposit platform for data IPR, and issued the country\'s first rule for data IPR protection for open-source communities and first pledge standard on data IPR, so as to make data ownership clearer, better exploit IPR and make proofing of IPR easier, said Gu Wenhai, deputy director of Zhejiang province\'s intellectual property administration.China\'s first national pilot project for the standardization of data IPR also landed in Zhejiang, Gu told People\'s Daily.Boehringer Ingelheim, a German multinational pharmaceutical company, owns patents of its self-developed innovative medicines in its Shanghai office.\"We feel the importance attached by the Chinese government to IPR protection and to maintaining fair market competition,\" said an executive of the company.As the number of patents owned by foreign enterprises in China keeps growing, IPR is contributing significantly to the high-level opening up of the country.In the Yangtze River Delta region, Shanghai has launched a special campaign for the protection of foreign companies\' IPR for three years in a row, during which over 60 IPR disputes and infringement cases were handled.Shanghai, in collaboration with intellectual property departments from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, has carried out regular dialogues and exchanges for foreign enterprises to understand their demands for IPR protection, and inform them of IPR laws, regulations, services and measures.To assist China\'s high-level opening up, the CNIPA launched pilot programs aiming at establishing permanent representative offices of foreign patent agencies in IPR service clusters, including the Suzhou New District and the Jiangning district of Nanjing, Jiangsu province, building them into international hubs of IPR services,\" said Liang.', 'IPR', '2023-07-15', 'By Gu Yekai () 11:15, July 15, 2023', 'People visit the 9th China (Shanghai) International Technology Fair in east China\'s Shanghai, June', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-16 09:46:22', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0715/c90000-20044747.html');

(Xinhua/Deng Hua)BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China\'s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector has entered a new stage of high-quality development, marked by a steady increase in output, sales, exports, and consumption potential.The country has seen its NEV output growing exponentially. The 20 millionth NEV rolled off the production line on July 3 in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, marking a milestone for the sector. The accumulative NEV output only exceeded 10 million units in February last year.In the first half of 2023, the NEV output expanded 42.4 percent year on year to nearly 3.79 million units, while the NEV sales surged 44.1 percent year on year to almost 3.75 million units, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed.The country exported 534,000 NEVs during the same period, expanding 160 percent from a year earlier.BYD, one of China\'s fastest-growing electric vehicle makers, has exported its automobiles to over 70 countries and regions.China\'s NEV sector is gaining a competitive edge in scale and quality, and the Chinese-branded vehicles exported are cost-effective, said Zhu Yifang, a researcher at the automotive strategy and policy research center under the China Automotive Technology and Research Center Co., Ltd.Building on the robust growth momentum, China has stepped up policy support in the NEV sector, particularly in its vast rural areas.In May, China released a guideline to support people living in rural areas to purchase NEVs, focusing on boosting the construction of charging infrastructure.To further unleash the domestic consumption potential, China extended its preferential purchase tax policy for NEVs to the end of 2027.Preliminary estimates show the policy will result in 520 billion yuan (about 72.91 billion U.S. dollars) in tax exemptions and reductions.Infrastructure, including charging facilities, has also seen a notable improvement in recent years.The number of charging piles has increased from less than 100,000 in 2015 to 5.21 million in 2022. By the end of May this year, China\'s charging piles reached nearly 6.36 million.As of the end of 2022, there were 226 vehicles per 1,000 people in China, and many families had never owned a car. The auto market still has massive room for growth, said Fu Bingfeng, executive vice president and secretary general of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.With NEVs becoming more popular among Chinese consumers, third- and fourth-tier cities and rural areas may record faster market growth, Fu said, adding that the number of vehicles per 1,000 people will likely reach 400 in the future.The NEV sector has entered a new stage of large-scale, globalized, and high-quality development, becoming an important part of China\'s modern industrial system, said Fu.', 'Aion Chinas sector GAC output charging NEVs Energy number ru', '2023-07-17', ' (Xinhua) 08:17, July 17, 2023', 'This photo taken on July 3, 2023 shows the final inspection line at the general assembly workshop o', '人民日报海外版', 'utf-8', '2023-07-17 20:19:21', 'http://en.people.cn/n3/2023/0717/c90000-20044811.html');

(People’s Daily Online/Zhang Ruohan)Nestled within the time-worn alley of Yangmeizhuxie street, an ancient Chinese hutong, a captivating group of meticulously crafted pandas captures the attention of passersby. These endearing creatures come to life under the skilled hands of the remarkable artist, Yoshiko Tebido from Japan, who has mastered the traditional art of Chinese wood engraving.Yoshiko\'s panda series transcends mere depictions. From commemorating historical milestones to capturing everyday experiences, her personalized pandas become visual narratives that unfold on the canvas of her prints, casting a spell on the hearts of both Chinese and visitors from afar.\"I may not be an art professional but I am drawn to the shapes and expressions of these panda icons,\" said a visitor to Yoshiko\'s exhibition in the art boutique Qiankun Space.\" They are not just lifeless images but storytellers that invite us to engage with significant moments and intricacies of Chinese life.\"The panda collection is a reflection of Yoshiko’s artistic concepts, documenting and immortalizing the traditions, customs and rich cultural tapestry of Chinese society. With each stroke of her engraving tools, she delicately captures the spirit of daily life in China, showcasing vivid scenes of bustling streets, people\'s activities and the beauty of traditional Chinese techniques.\"I enjoy observing happy moments of Chinese life in the parks. I found it interesting to document these ephemeral moments, capturing the joy and resilience of Chinese society,\" she said. \"Through my work, I hope to serve as evidence of our well-lived days in China.\"Yoshiko\'s artworks have gained popularity in both China and Japan. The intricate engravings speak to the hearts of Chinese locals, resonating with their cultural reverence for the cherished creatures, familiar traditions and ancient craftsmanship and techniques. At the same time, the universal appeal of the panda has captivated visitors from diverse backgrounds, piquing their curiosity and nurturing their appreciation of China.As a universal language, art transcends borders and unites diverse cultures. Yoshiko’s masterful engravings are infused with Chinese elements, and play a pivotal role in cultivating cross-cultural understanding and fostering mutual respect, bridging the cultural gap and creating a shared experience of awe and appreciation between diverse audiences.\"I aim to introduce the adorable and interesting aspects of China to Japan through the medium of engravings,\" said Yoshiko.Yoshiko\'s deep appreciation for Chinese culture began over two decades ago when she first set foot in China to study traditional engraving. Since then, she has been captivated by the beauty and intricacy of Chinese traditional art, fully immersing herself in this ancient craft.\"Chinese art possesses an extraordinary allure. Its vibrant colors exude remarkable power,\" said Yoshiko, acknowledging that those traditional arts have withstood the test of a thousand years, continuing to tell tales that resonate deeply with people.\"The power of storytelling becomes the very essence from which all artistic expressions draw inspiration, a force that continues to leave an indelible impression,\" said Yoshiko.Guided by an unwavering passion, she delved into the intricate artistry of traditional Chinese art, drawing inspiration from Chinese culture, which ultimately shaped her unique personal style.While many fans applaud Yoshiko\'s artwork for its Chinese features, she never intentionally adds Chinese element to her creations. \"I personally don\'t feel that any specific Chinese culture or art has directly influence on my artwork,\" she said. \"My influences are derived from my everyday life in China.\"\"The gradual accumulation of knowledge and understanding of Chinese culture has shaped my sense of aesthetics, naturally manifesting in my work,\" she added.Exquisite panda illustrations designed by renowned Japanese artist Yoshiko Tebido. (People\'s Daily Online/Wu Chaolan)Guardian of traditionYoshiko\'s artistic odyssey extends beyond the realms of her enchanting engravings. She has also taken on an important role safeguarding and promoting traditional Chinese craftsmanship and culture. While her artistry is often praised for its innovative approach, incorporating traditional Chinese crafts, her true motivation lies in preserving these ancient techniques and bringing attention to their beauty and significance.In her recent creations, Yoshiko utilized xiabu, or grass linen, a traditional garment material used by the Han nationality in China since the Xia-Shang-Zhou Period. According to Yoshiko, this material was commonly used for clothing during China\'s Tang Dynasty and Japan\'s Nara period. It saw a sharp decline in production after the advent of cotton and is now at risk of disappearing. Though Yoshiko\'s own use of the fabric is modest, she transforms these materials into artworks, granting them a renewed sense of longevity before their potential extinction.\"Many of my creations are motivated by a desire to revive and celebrate traditional materials,\" said Yoshiko. \"I contemplate what I can do to preserve these endangered materials, ensuring they are not forgotten or lost to history.\"To keep the legacy of traditional Chinese crafts alive, Yoshiko has also taken on the role of an instructor who delivers lectures to art enthusiasts at Qiankun Space, imparting her knowledge of traditional Chinese engravings and shedding light on their beauty and cultural significance. She recognizes that by actively engaging in the transmission of these precious traditions, she contributes to the preservation and continuity of these ancestral treasures.\"The techniques and craftsmanship we study today are not inventions of our generation but treasures passed down by our ancestors,\" she said. \"It is our duty to carry forward these invaluable gifts from the past to the 21st century and beyond.\"Through her lectures on Chinese cultural heritage, she nurtures young minds, which not only ensures its survival but also inspires others to appreciate the beauty and significance embedded within the rich heritage.\"I will continually hone my own skills, with the aim of passing on these valuable techniques to as many individuals as possible who have a genuine interest in learning,\" she said.As Yoshiko\'s captivating artwork and lectures find a home within the ancient hutong, hearts unite in admiration of her enchanting creations.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Gareth Bonello: unlocking Li Bai’s romantic poetry through music - People\'s Daily Online', '\nDrinking beneath the blooming peach blossoms, gazing at the waterfall on Mount Lu and bathing in the Mid-Autumn Festival’s full moon…Welsh musician and songwriter, Gareth Bonello, shares the romantic poems of Li Bai with Western listeners through music. In 2011, Bonello took up a residency in Chengdu and produced Y Bardd Anfarwol (The Immortal Bard), an album based on the life story of the famous Chinese poet Li Bai.Bonello is fascinated by Chinese traditional music, and Y Bardd Anfarwol merges Li Bai’s poetry with Welsh traditional music, Welsh folklore, and Chinese traditional instruments, such as the erhu, guzheng, pipa and xiao. This harmonious fusion transcends spatial and cultural boundaries, and even today Bonello performs songs from this album at his live performances; they are on the set list of his UK tour this summer.Gareth Bonello (Photo/ Patrick Shead-Simmonds)In recent years, Bonello has been studying for a PhD with the University of South Wales, delving into the music of Khasi Hills in Northeast India and the links between Wales and the region, which has brought in more musical traditions into his work. Going forward, Bonello hopes to write more music with Chinese musicians to open another window for Westerners to understand Chinese history and culture.A musical encounter with ChengduGareth Bonello performing in ChengduPeople’s Daily Online: You first visited Chengdu as a musician in residence to find inspiration for your music. What impression did Chengdu leave you with?Gareth Bonello: In 2011, I was given the opportunity to take up a residency at the Chengdu Associated Theatre of Performing Arts , organised by the British Council and PRS Foundation. I was there for seven weeks and worked with many musicians from the Associated Theatre. I have never been to China before, so this was really an experience for me. I was completely blown away by Chengdu. The impression I had was of a city that was rapidly being built up. It was busy, but also continued to be connected to its heritage and its past. The other thing about Chengdu was the delicious food. I have never come across food like that before so much spice and heat.People’s Daily Online: Working as a musician in residence in Chengdu, you had many opportunities to exchange ideas with local Chinese artists. What were some of the more memorable exchanges?Gareth Bonello: While I did my best to try to pick up as much Chinese as I could in Chengdu, my Chinese was still a work in progress, and most of the musicians at the Associated Theatre did not speak English either. So, we were communicating through music. I think the strength of music is that you do not need a language and you do not need to share even a culture; people can appreciate music on an emotional level and on an intellectual level. I had an amazing exposure to music, dancing, and lots of instruments that I had never heard before. I sat with the musicians individually and asked them to play me something from their instruments, so I could get a sense of what the instrument sounded like. I just remember the first time I heard Jiang Qian playing the guzheng on live. It blew me away. The range of sounds that she was able to get out of it, the story, and the journeys she could take you on through playing some traditional Sichuan pieces and well-known traditional Chinese pieces were just fantastic.People’s Daily Online: What aspects of Chinese music did you enjoy the most?Gareth Bonello: I was fascinated by the variety of sounds that Chinese instruments could make and gradually got to know the range of the instruments and what they can do. The Chinese scales were very interesting, following a pentatonic scale, and that was one of the first times I had come across scales like this outside of Blues tradition. The variety of melodies that were being presented to me through these five notes was just beautiful. I found the tradition of making sounds that imitate certain animals or scenes in Chinese music very interesting. Musicians would pluck the cajon to make it sound like a goose or a flock of geese coming in to land. Music is not just melodic but abstract, as well as creating sounds that you hear in the natural world. This really inspired me.Using Welsh music to understand Li Bai’s poetryY Bardd Anfarwol (The Immortal Bard)People’s Daily Online: Li Bai is one of the most famous poets in China, but Westerners know very little about him. Could you share with us the story behind Y Bardd Anfarwol?Gareth Bonello: I wanted to tell the story of Li Bai through music, and the album explores from his young early days leaving home and trying to find inspiration in the mountains and then goes to his death. Many songs in the album used Li Bai’s own words or his own images to describe his life journey, including poems like Ballads of Four Seasons, Quiet Night Thought and Drinking Alone Under the Moon. My song Antiffoni was inspired by Li Bai’s Question and Answer on the Mountain and The Priest of T’en Mountain. In the song, I wrote “Bu’m ar daith dros bryn a ddŵr/ Am gyngor gŵr doeth penwyn/ A oes hadau wedi’u hau/ Ymhlith y blodau eirin?” Li Bai writes so romantically, and I find it very magical that Li Bai could convey profound ideas through a few simple lines of poetry. I think this is why he is one of the most famous Chinese poets.On top of that, I wanted to do a sound portrait of Chengdu. I was doing a lot of field recordings of different spots in Chengdu, for example, people selling noodles, workers labouring on construction site and birds singing in the park, to try to capture some of modern China. I wanted to give something back to Chengdu because the musicians I collaborated with for this album were all based there.I collaborated here in the UK with The Mavron String Quartet, a composer called Seb Goldfinch and the UK Chinese ensemble based in London, as well as recording some of the pieces that had elements of Chinese traditional music in Chengdu with local musicians. So, in the end, it was a real collaboration of musicians from Wales, from London and from China.People’s Daily Online: How was the album received by listeners in the West?Gareth Bonello: Y Bardd Anfarwol was very popular and particularly well received in Wales. People were very fascinated by it because there had not been anything like it done before. It won the Welsh Language album of the year in the 2014 Eisteddfod, which is a high honor in Welsh culture. I felt glad about sharing the work I have done in China with people from different places, which has allowed a lot more people in Wales now to have an understanding of Li Bai and Chinese traditional music. The album also inspired a Welsh stage production called Rhith Gan by Wyn Mason. Mason became fascinated by Li Bai because of my album and wrote a modern drama about the relationship between a daughter and a father. Li Bai is kind of like a spirit guide, appearing as the father’s mentor in the play. I was able to provide musical accompaniment to the performance, playing the pipa and guitar off the side. The production won a drama medal at the 2015 Eisteddfod.People’s Daily Online: People can connect with music through melody without being able to fully understand the lyrics. Many Chinese people bonded with your music, even though it was written in Welsh. How was the reception for this album among Chinese audiences?Gareth Bonello: Chinese audiences were really interested in the combination of Welsh folk and classical style music with traditional Chinese music, which they had never heard before. They were fascinated to learn more about the work that I had done, as well as why I was interested in Li Bai and Chinese traditional music. I was invited to perform Y Bardd Anfarwol in many Chinese cities including Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Kunming. I had a wonderful time touring, and it was the first time I have been reunited with the musicians that had recorded on the album back in 2013.Sharing is the strength of musicGareth BonelloPeople’s Daily Online: How do you bring together elements of Chinese music with Welsh traditional music and folklore in your work?Gareth Bonello: At the moment I have been working on a new album of Welsh traditional music and the collaboration with the musicians in China had made me rethink and relearn the way that I played the guitar, which remains to this day. So, when I play the guitar, sometimes it can sound like a Chinese instrument, or it can sound like Chinese scales. I still do play some of the songs from Y Bardd Anfarwol live. For instance, last weekend I was in Swansea, and I played one of the travelling songs, Yr Wylan Fry, which is about Li Bai\'s departure from White King City. Hopefully one day I will get a chance to play the album in its entirety again with all the musicians.People’s Daily Online: Recently, you have been studying for a PhD at the University of South Wales, exploring the music of Khasi Hills in Northeast India. What is the value of understanding different musical traditions and collaborating with people from all over the world?Gareth Bonello: International collaborations is not just about creating a piece that works together, but also to understand your own culture a little better and then reflecting it back to your people. I hope through interacting more with other cultures through music, there will be better understanding between cultures. If international collaboration is done right and sensitively with trust, it is very valuable. It is much better that people are talking with instruments and sharing rather than arguing over tables or with guns. Sharing is the strength of music and a way to bring people from different cultural backgrounds together. Music is a way of communicating without language.People’s Daily Online: To continue cultural exchanges, what new collaborations do you hope to form with Chinese musicians in the future?Gareth Bonello: An aspect I did not explore before was folk music. I would be fascinated to learn more about Chinese folk music, which is more earthly than traditional Chinese music. To do that I would probably need to visit more remote areas and villages, which is the kind of work I have been doing in northeast India recently.

(Photo by Mohammed Mohammed/Xinhua)HODEIDAH, Yemen, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations delivered a replacement vessel to Yemen\'s Houthi group on Monday as part of an urgent mission to avert a potential oil spill from the decaying Safer tanker off Yemen\'s western coast.The handover ceremony took place aboard the Nautica, the replacement tanker chartered by the UN in March that has arrived at the location of the Safer on Sunday. During the ceremony, which was attended by UN officials and representatives from the Houthi authorities, the tanker was officially renamed the Yemen, a Xinhua correspondent witnessed.A team employed by the UN will start the transfer of approximately 1.14 million barrels of crude oil from the Safer to the Yemen in the coming days.The Safer, originally constructed as a supertanker in 1976 and later converted to a floating storage and offloading facility (FSO) for oil, is currently moored approximately 4.8 nautical miles off the coast of Hodeidah Province in Yemen.Currently, the Safer is under the control of the Houthis. However, the internationally recognized government of Yemen also asserts ownership of the tanker and its crude oil. The disputes between the two sides have disrupted the regular maintenance of the tanker, resulting in its decay over the years.The UN has warned that a spill from the FSO Safer could have a devastating impact on the Red Sea and the coastline of Yemen. The spill could release four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, which killed thousands of seabirds and marine mammals and caused widespread environmental damage.This photo taken on July 17, 2023 shows the upper deck of the Nautica, a tanker chartered by the United Nations to transfer crude oil from the decaying Safer tanker, off the coast of the Hodeidah Province, western Yemen.

[Photo by Liu Jianhua/For China Daily]China\'s youth unemployment rate, which had increased in recent months, is expected to go down in August thanks to a recovering economy and the wide implementation of employment policies.According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, the unemployment rate among surveyed young people, age 16 to 24, rose to 21.3 percent in June, compared with 20.8 percent in May and 20.4 percent in April.However, the unemployment rate in urban areas in June remained unchanged at 5.2 percent compared with May, data showed.Speaking at a news conference in Beijing on Monday, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said the youth unemployment rate sees \"seasonal fluctuations\". It goes up during graduation season due to the influx of young graduates into the job market.\"The rate will decrease gradually from August, with the graduation season coming to an end and young people landing jobs,\" Fu said.Pang Shi, director of the Chinese Academy of Personnel Science\'s department of employment and entrepreneurship, said the employment of young people is a global issue. China not only faces the common pressures of youth employment seen in other countries and regions, it also has specific problems because of its current stage of development, she said.The labor market experiences fluctuations as the economic cycle progresses, Pang said, noting that the imbalance between youth labor supply and market demand, as well as young people\'s career views, affects the group\'s employment prospects.\"For example, most young graduates still favor metropolises and large companies, State-owned companies and government departments being their top choices, while nearly 80 percent of market demand is from private companies,\" she said.Many graduates delay their job-seeking plans until after they receive their civil service exam results, and in the process miss out on job opportunities, Pang said.Also, information overload and mixed voices on the internet can trigger anxiety among young people, which may lower their confidence levels and affect their will to work, she added.Authorities at all levels have prioritized the employment of young people in recent years, and have launched and implemented a range of supportive policies and measures to help them land jobs, which in turn has protected their right to work.On June 6, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security launched a campaign that aims to collect information about more than 10 million job vacancies for college graduates and young people in 100 days.As part of the campaign, job fairs are being organized every week. Between July 10 and Sunday, four online job fairs were organized by the ministry. They attracted around 17,000 recruiters who offered 860,000 vacancies.The ministry also released China\'s first regulation on the management of human resources agencies recently to tighten supervision over their operations in order to ensure a safer job market, especially for young people who lack experience.The regulation applies to agencies and organizations offering human resources services, including collecting and publishing job information, offering consultancy and guidance, and having labor dispatching services. The regulation will take effect on Aug 1.Pang said the fundamental way of tackling youth employment challenges is developing the economy to create more job opportunities and improving the stability of these jobs.Private companies make a large contribution to both economic stability and job security, and authorities at all levels can formulate favorable policies to encourage them to create more vacancies, she added.', 'rate Youth improve August their Pang levels percent graduate', '2023-07-18', 'By CHENG SI (Chinadaily.com.cn) 09:42, July 18, 2023', 'Candidates look at employment opportunities at a job fair in Nanjing, Jiangsu province.

LI MINGFA/FOR CHINA DAILYGiven the slower-than-anticipated consumption growth in June, well-targeted policy steps are needed to keep the tasks of boosting domestic demand and shoring up consumption high on China\'s work agenda, as part of the country\'s efforts to a sustain steady economic upturn, experts said on Monday.To be sure, consumption picked up in the past few months, serving as the main growth engine. But, it has not fully established a solid foundation yet — so, more forceful measures are needed to increase household incomes and spur big-ticket items in a mutually reinforcing way, they said.Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday showed the country\'s retail sales of consumer goods totaled around 22.76 trillion yuan ($3.17 trillion) in the first half of the year, up 8.2 percent year-on-year. In June alone, the figure edged up 3.1 percent compared with the same period last year, and amounted to 3.99 trillion yuan.Lackluster consumer demand has partly resulted in the Consumer Price Index, the main gauge of inflation, coming in flat in June compared with the same period last year, NBS data showed earlier. The People\'s Bank of China, the country\'s central bank, said on Friday that a further dip in the CPI might be expected this month, but inflation will likely pick up gradually from August to reach a level close to 1 percent by the end of the year.Wen Bin, chief economist at China Minsheng Bank, said China has fully resumed normal order in its social and economic activities from the beginning of this year, and also announced stronger policies to stimulate consumption.Besides, the May Day holiday and Dragon Boat Festival bolstered consumer spending in various sectors, including catering and tourism.Consumption maintained an overall robust momentum, spurring recovery, and has played a bigger role in driving economic growth, Wen said, adding it, however, eased in June with retail sales logging the slowest growth since December when the country lifted most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.The slowdown in consumption growth is partly attributable to the decline in car sales and the ailing property market in June, which should receive high priority in the form of more government support, Wen said.Data from the China Passenger Car Association showed that in the June 1-25 period, car sales fell 1 percent from the same period last year. Meanwhile, new home prices stayed unchanged in June from a year earlier, retreating from a 0.1 percent increase in May, NBS data showed.Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the economic policy committee at the China Association of Policy Science, said more support should be extended to consumer spending on big-ticket items like new energy vehicles and home appliances, especially in the vast rural areas that have a huge potential to stir consumption.According to a CPCA estimate, the penetration rate of NEVs in counties and townships came in at 17 percent compared with some 30 percent in cities even with purchase restrictions in place.High-end consumption in big cities should not be the country\'s sole focus. Rural consumption capacity is modest, but it can grow and bring about consumption upgrade, Xu said.The Ministry of Commerce recently rolled out a slew of policies to accelerate the recovery and expansion of consumption in the home appliances segment. These included subsidies for trading in old goods and purchasing green smart home appliances, and promotional campaigns to boost purchases of home appliances in rural areas.Going forward, every possible means should be explored to increase household incomes, so as to boost their capacity and willingness to spend and thus better underpin the sustainable growth of consumption in the long run, Xu said.China\'s per capita disposable income stood at 19,672 yuan in the first half, up 6.5 percent year-on-year in nominal terms, NBS data showed.

(Photo from LandSpace)China on July 12 successfully launched a new carrier rocket into space from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket is the world\'s first rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel and successfully entered its planned orbit, as well as the first liquid-propellant rocket entering its planned orbit independently developed by a Chinese private rocket company.The successful launch marked that China\'s first high-thrust liquid oxygen-methane engine has completed a flight mission, and a breakthrough in the new low-cost, liquid propellant application for China\'s carrier rockets.The Zhuque-2 is a two-stage rocket with a body diameter of 3.35 meters and a height of 49.5 meters. Its takeoff weight is about 219 tons, and its takeoff thrust is about 268 tons.The stage 1 of the rocket is powered by four Tianque-12 (TQ-12) engines each with a vacuum thrust of 80 tons, and the stage 2 by a single TQ-12 engine and four TQ-11 vernier engines.Carrier rocket, as a launch vehicle, is the foundation of all space activities, and the engine is the \"heart\" of a rocket, while the propellant decides the key performance of a rocket.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, July 12, 2023. (Photo from LandSpace)Rocket propellants include liquid fuels and solid fuels. In particular, liquid fuels include liquid oxygen (LOX)/kerosene, LOX/liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen-methane, etc. Each of the fuels has its advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the LOX/kerosene fuel features low cost and high specific impulse, but it\'s prone to carbon deposition and coking.Liquid oxygen-methane is a mixture of liquid oxygen and methane. It is efficient, green, cheap and easily extracted. It comes with less carbon deposition, which reduces the workload in engine cleaning and thus lowers the maintenance cost of reusable rockets. That\'s why it is considered one of the ideal materials for making rocket propellants.According to Zhang Changwu, CEO of LandSpace, the company that developed the Zhuque-2, liquid oxygen and methane are widely applied in both the civil and industrial sectors, and they are very accessible and cheap.The cost of this propellant, which is expected to become an industrial product in massive supply once the technology of liquid oxygen-methane engine matures, will be more controllable, Zhang added.Aerospace is a technologically challenging industry with high risks. The world today has entered a rapid development phase of reusable liquid oxygen-methane rockets. Multiple such rockets are underway outside China. In the first half of this year alone, two other liquid oxygen-methane rockets were launched, but they both failed unfortunately.The development of the Zhuque-2 carrier rocket was no plain sailing. At the end of the last year, it failed in its first mission. LandSpace established an investigation group to look into the reasons causing the failure and adopted multiple measures for improvement.The Zhuque-2 carrier rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, July 12, 2023. (Photo from LandSpace)It was not easy for the company to achieve the success today after it experienced the failure in the first mission of the Zhuque-2. The development team did a huge amount of work, including launch tests, ground vibration tests, hydraulic tests and final assembly detection.\"What we achieved this time was not only a successful launch of a rocket, but also the capability of a private aerospace company in developing, testing, manufacturing and launching rockets. We\'ll keep going toward our goal of massive and commercial rocket development and manufacturing, and prove our value with innovation,\" Zhang said.As the first Chinese rocket powered by liquid oxygen-methane fuel, the Zhuque-2 is expected to lower the cost of commercial rocket launching and bring a revolution to the market of commercial rocket launching.Zhang said that the company will keep upgrading the Zhuque series to improve its performance and offer the market with low-cost, high-performance and high-thrust rockets.The private aerospace sector has experienced rapid development over the past 10 years and become an indispensable force in China\'s aerospace industry. It covers rocket launching, satellite and ground facility development, satellite operation, satellite application and other areas.According to statistics, China is home to more than 400 private aerospace companies that operate over 350 in-orbit satellites. The private aerospace sector has released considerable economic potential, with a market size of over 1 trillion yuan ($139.59 billion).Experts noted that China is seeing a significant increase in the frequency and number of space launches, as well as a huge demand for commercial launches.

Classified into three grades, these major air polluters will be subject to varying restrictions.Some companies may claim they have reduced production by 50 percent as required. But if there is almost no change in their power consumption, this indicates that they have lied, Zhao said.Thanks to support from five affiliates with the ministry, including the Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering, the Satellite Application Center and the China National Environmental Monitoring Center, the ministry has developed an information-based platform to support its law enforcement work.With data models that can help recognize over 40 types of evidence for violations related to air pollutant emissions, the platform will transfer all clues it finds to local environmental authorities for field inspection, he said.Based on feedback from local environmental authorities, he said the ministry will carry out field visits to ensure all problems have been rectified.The bureau is now able to unearth violations in a very precise manner, he said. The effectiveness of its on-site work has been greatly enhanced.Since May last year, the bureau has transferred evidence about air pollutant emissions involving over 20,000 companies to local environmental authorities.

The workshop was part of the professional training programs offered by China\'s vocational education colleges with the aim of sharing expertise.\"My country wants to cultivate well-skilled human capital for industry, especially in the private sector in Ethiopia and throughout East Africa. My mission is to be the best teacher returning home to pass on the knowledge I acquired in China,\" he said.Like many African nations, the vocational education system in Ethiopia is still in its infancy, and sharing experience from China is vital to enable the transfer of technologies to small and micro businesses, he added.To date, Chinese colleges have established 11 Luban Workshops in African countries, offering a wide range of professional training and help for the younger generation in these nations to build up their professional skills.Named after Lu Ban, an ancient Chinese woodcraft master, the workshops have risen in popularity in recent years to become a centerpiece of the drive by Beijing to promote international cooperation on vocational education.Liu Bin, president of the Alliance for the Development of Luban Workshops, said a crucial factor behind the flourishing vocational training programs is that they seek to meet surging demand for improved local labor forces as Chinese businesses and products go global.A total of 27 Luban Workshops have been established in 25 countries, most of them in the developing world. The programs provide training in vocational skills tailored to meet the demands of host countries.Another crucial factor underpinning the popularity of the workshops is the deepening cooperation between China and countries taking part in the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. \"Advancing the BRI gave rise to the need for Luban Workshops, which has also given impetus to the initiative,\" Liu said.Most of the workshops are located at vocational colleges in host countries, and they are usually established through partnerships between such colleges in China and their local counterparts. The Chinese institutions share their equipment, teaching methods and materials, and provide training for teachers.Since the first Luban Workshop outside China was set up in Thailand in 2016, the 27 workshops established to date offer degrees to more than 6,100 students and temporary training programs for some 31,500 students.

Legal experts and political heavyweights expressed full support for the police move, saying it is prudent, legitimate and can carry a deterrent effect on other activists.Hong Kong police on Monday offered a reward of HK$1 million ($128,000) for each of the eight fugitives wanted for endangering national security after the court approved the issuance of arrest warrants against them. They comprise three exiled former lawmakers and five other people who have allegedly advocated separatism and sought foreign sanctions against Hong Kong.A group of overseas politicians and organizations, including a spokesperson for the United States\' Department of State, relevant congressional bodies, the US Consulate General in Hong Kong, and the British foreign secretary, have since criticized the arrest warrants and openly slandered the National Security Law for Hong Kong.A spokesperson for the commissioner\'s office in the HKSAR strongly rebuked the behavior of overseas politicians, pointing out that the eight fugitives have long been engaged in actions that jeopardize national security.Even after fleeing overseas, the fugitives have continued to spread political rumors and advocate \"Hong Kong independence\", actively encouraging foreign interference in the SAR\'s affairs, and sanctions against Hong Kong.Such behaviors openly challenged the authority of the National Security Law for Hong Kong and the bottom line of \"one country, two systems\", posing a grave threat to national sovereignty, security and development interests, the spokesperson said.The spokesperson emphasized that Hong Kong police have acted in accordance with the law by pursuing these anti-China disrupters, and their actions are also in line with international law and common practices. It\'s a legitimate move by the SAR to safeguard national security, protect the rule of law and uphold social justice.At a news conference, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mao Ning said the eight seriously hurt the fundamental interests of Hong Kong SAR and endangered China\'s sovereignty, security and development interests.The spokesperson added that relevant countries should respect China\'s sovereignty and the rule of law in the Hong Kong SAR, and stop supporting and sheltering such activists. China is determined to oppose any external interference in Hong Kong SAR affairs, she added.Meeting reporters on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu and Secretary for Security Chris Tang Ping-keung said the government will do everything possible to bring the criminals to justice. Lee also called on the public, including relatives of the fugitives, to offer information to help the police track them down.The only way to cancel the warrant is for the fugitives to surrender themselves, he said. Under the National Security Law, surrendering may result in the court considering a reduction in sentence, but otherwise, the individual will remain a fugitive for life and live in constant fear of arrest, Lee stressed.Veteran solicitor and legislator Kennedy Wong Ying-ho said the eight have become fugitives following the issuance of the warrants. He said their activities have now been restricted and they\'re under extreme pressure.Although the activists have fled overseas, they might go to places that have signed agreements with Hong Kong on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, Wong said. They would be detained once they return to the SAR.Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, convener of the Executive Council and former secretary for security of the HKSAR, said that the police\'s efforts to track down eight fugitives have a deterrent effect, which can intimidate their followers.Lawmaker Lai Tung-kwok, who also served as secretary for security of the HKSAR, said that the government\'s arrests will restrict the movement of activists.Lai also believed that the government\'s high-profile arrests are not only intended to apprehend activists, but also to caution their supporters.The government aims to convey to these supporters that they are violating the law if they provide financial or other forms of support to the fugitives, Lai added.Oasis Hu contributed to this story.', 'security,fugitives,law,national,police,foreign,activists,Hong,Kong', '2023-07-05', '马清', 'Central government officials on Tuesday firmly rejected foreign politicians\' interference in, and condemnation of the Hong Kong police\'s lawful act of putting eight fugitives on the wanted list for endangering national security.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 18:33:01', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/05/WS64a4a72ea310bf8a75d6d3c0.html');

The moments when they encounter Chinese culture in the UK are memorable, most of which are associated with Chinese food.Hot pot seems to have become a signature Chinese dish overseas in recent years. Kevan Kennedy, a PhD student at Cambridge University, UK, recalled the time when his Sichuan friend invited him to have a Sichuan hot pot for the new year celebration.\"It was literally the best food I\'ve ever had in my life,\" he said. But what has impressed him even more is the Chinese feeling of family and their embrace of the world. \"When you become good friends with Chinese people, you begin to realize that they really take you in and make you family.\"Victor Kovalets, from Ukraine, has also noticed that hot pot is getting more popular overseas. \"Around 10, 15 years ago, most people in the West didn\'t know what hot pot was. Now there are so many hot pot restaurants. Everywhere you go, there are new Chinese restaurants opening up,\" he said.Not only is Chinese food becoming more present in people\'s daily lives in the international community, but also Chinese technology and online platforms are taking off. The young guests shared their experience of using Chinese-brand smartphones like One-plus and Chinese apps such as TikTok and Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book).On these Chinese social media platforms, they search for information, make friends and organize events. Jamila James from the UK, for example, has been posting vlogs on Xiaohongshu, as she has found that Chinese people want to know more about the British lifestyle. \"This is how I\'m bridging the gap between the Chinese and the British,\" she said.Yu Lutong, from China, thinks it\'s a good thing that China\'s technological influence is growing and people across the globe are getting more connected. \"We know more about other people, and we can learn more things from them,\" he said.Sam Hardy from the UK is a student at the University of London and will come to China in September to study at Beijing Normal University. He is not only learning about Chinese culture but also introducing it to more people in the UK. When he visited China in 2019, he enjoyed pingtan music in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, and developed an interest in traditional Chinese musical instruments. After returning to the UK, he joined the Jiangnan Silk and Bamboo Ensemble at his university, learned many different styles of traditional Chinese music, and later performed all over the south of England with the ensemble.In his eyes, music allows for a very special type of cross-cultural exchange. He learned that as early as in China\'s Xia and Shang dynasties, music was a language of cross-cultural exchange between China and its neighbors, and it continues to be so to this day. The rise of many traditional Chinese instrument ensemble groups on social media is a good example.\"They perform not only Chinese pieces, but also popular foreign classical works. It is because of this blending of that which is innately Chinese and non-Chinese that I believe that they are a fantastic example of how music can be a language that transcends languages,\" he said in his speech at Youth Power.Although cultural exchanges are thriving between countries, they sometimes face challenges and controversies. Some cultural exchange activities are labeled as \"cultural appropriation\", which has become a buzzword in recent years, especially online.On this topic, Lisa Maslova, from Russia, mentioned last year\'s scandal of the French luxury brand Dior drawing inspiration from China\'s horse face skirt but failing to mention it. \"We should acknowledge where we get our inspiration from. Similarly, when you\'re doing academic writing for a PhD, you use references,\" she said. \"So I think whenever you\'re being inspired by certain cultural values or certain traditional trends, just make sure you acknowledge that, and that\'d be cool.\"Kevin Zhu, who is both British and American, is now studying strategic entrepreneurship and innovation at King\'s College London. He attaches importance to people\'s intentions when they show interest in other cultures. \"For example, if I see an English person wearing traditional Chinese clothing, sure, I don\'t mind if they wear it with pride, if they wear it respectfully, if they genuinely show interest in the culture and if they don\'t try to deface the culture or the representation in any way — then I am all for it,\" he explained.He compares culture to something that can be mixed in the melting pot of one\'s own life and character and thinks that it \"should not be able to be \'stolen\' or \'appropriated\'\".When summarizing important lessons to take away from the controversies, Zhong Yutong, the program host, said that youngsters should be more active in working with people from different cultures and should keep asking questions.\"\'Working with\' means that you see them as equal, respectful, and of course, very different people as well,\" he said. \"And we shouldn\'t stop asking questions or stop learning about each other just because we are afraid of falling into the trap of stereotypes.\"This resonates with Luo Xiaoyao, a Chinese actor who studies art in the UK and plays characters from different countries on stage. She once played a young single French lady in Sunday in the Park With George, a Swedish teenage girl in A Little Night Music, and an American-born-Chinese college student from UCLA\'s sorority Delta Nu in Legally Blonde.\"For me, bringing these characters to life requires a deep understanding of their cultural context and a willingness to immerse myself in a world that is not my own,\" she said. \"By acknowledging the potential of individuals to represent their cultures and by fostering open dialogue and exchange, we can cultivate a world that is more accepting, compassionate, and appreciative of diverse cultures and viewpoints.\"Contact the writer at guiqian@i21st.cn ', 'chinese,china,people,uk,cultural,music,culture,traditional,cultures,pot', '2023-07-05', '杨小玉', 'Gathering in London, the United Kingdom, young people from China and other countries and regions around the world discussed their understanding of Chinese culture and cultural exchanges under the theme \"The bonds of culture\".', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-05 18:33:02', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/05/WS64a4aee0a310bf8a75d6d3d4.html');

The answer is: within 5 seconds.Before May this year, only two people in the world — Kiromal Katibin and Veddriq Leonardo, both Indonesian athletes — were able to complete the speed climbing route — a 15-meter-high artificial wall with foot and hand holds — within 5 seconds in official events. But on May 30, Chinese speed climber Cao Long hit the finish pad at 4.98 seconds in the semifinal of the first National Rock Climbing Championship, held in Keqiao, Zhejiang province. Cao became the third-fastest person in the world — vertically speaking.But Cao himself doesn\'t care too much about the new nicknames given to him, such as \"fastest man in China\" or \"Chinese Spider-Man\".\"All of my teammates have the ability to do it, too. I just happened to have a bit more luck at that time,\" said the 23-year-old athlete of the China National Climbing Team and a senior student at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).According to Cao, the outcome of speed climbing can vary every time because it\'s a highly demanding and stressful sport. Unlike the other two climbing disciplines — lead climbing and bouldering, in which athletes take turns climbing the same routes — speed climbing is a competitive race where two climbers compete at the same time. It\'s also a sport that finishes in seconds, meaning that to succeed, everything has to be perfect — athletes should have the right amount of focus, confidence and courage to take risks. Any slipups could be disastrous in a sport where there are only milliseconds between victory and defeat.\"Keeping a level head is key. Everyone wants to win. But the more you want it, the more likely you\'ll mess up,\" said Cao. \"But being too calm and trying to avoid any mistakes won\'t do you any good either because that mindset takes away your edge and your willingness to fight.\"Cao noted, \"You just have to find the right balance.\"But this psychological pressure involved with speed climbing is, in fact, part of the reason why Cao loves the sport. \"The tension of competing side by side with another climber really excites me,\" he said. \"And I do enjoy the thrill when the outcome of a climb — be it during daily training or in an official competition — exceeds my personal best.\"In fact, Cao\'s encounter with climbing was quite coincidental. At the age of 8, Cao was taking a taekwondo class when he noticed a climbing gym downstairs. He convinced his parents to let him have a try. Later, when the time came that he had to choose between the two, he picked climbing as it was more challenging in his eyes.', 'cao,climbing,speed,national,time,training,china,sport,body,daily', '2023-07-05', '杨小玉', 'How fast can someone climb 15 meters — the height of a 5-story building?

Whenever a typhoon was approaching, everyone stocked up on food, and I was no exception. I remember one summer day in 2019 when I bought a lot of snacks and instant noodles from the supermarket. That night, I accidentally ate a box of expired instant noodles, which caused food poisoning and really scared those around me. Outside, the wind was howling and the rain was pouring heavily, making travel extremely difficult. Fortunately, we had a class monitor who immediately notified the counselor and the teachers in charge of international students. They called for emergency assistance right away. Despite the raging typhoon, they all braved the storm and took me to the hospital.I remember the counselor, teachers, and friends staying by my side, accompanying me for various examinations and being with me while I had injections and intravenous drips until two or three in the morning.In the following days, two male classmates took turns taking leave from their classes to care for me. Since I had a tube inserted in my nose and couldn\'t move, they helped me change clothes and regularly gave me massages, always checking whether I was comfortable. Everyone around me did all they could to help me, and their care and thoughtfulness were beyond measure.The five days of hospitalization eventually passed, but during those five days, although I felt ill, the care that my friends and teachers showed me made me feel like everything was worth it. Looking back, it truly gave me such a warm feeling inside. They were like family, making me feel less lonely while studying in a foreign country.It was also during that year\'s Spring Festival that I decided to spend the Chinese New Year in China. Unexpectedly, the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 left me with nowhere to go. Fortunately, a classmate invited me to stay at her home for a while to get through that difficult time. Her family was very friendly and treated me like their own child. They cooked delicious homemade meals for me. Knowing that I liked pickled radish salad, the grandmother served this dish every day at mealtime. This act deeply moved me and reminded me of my family back in Vietnam. It was unexpected that even in a foreign land, I could feel the warmth and love of family.While staying at their home, I often helped with the household chores, such as washing dishes and cleaning. Occasionally, I would cook Vietnamese dishes for them. For me, sharing delicious food with others brings happiness, and it was my way of expressing gratitude to my friend and her family. I\'m so thankful for their help when I was going through a difficult time.After graduating from university, my classmates and I all went our separate ways and pursued our own paths. Some worked in State-owned enterprises while others chose to become teachers. At that time, I went back to Vietnam. But it seems like destiny that the girl who invited me to her home that Spring Festival ended up working in a Chinese construction company and was sent to Vietnam on a three-year contract. We reunited in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam.It was pouring rain that day when I rode my motorcycle to pick her up and bring her to my home. My mother was ecstatic upon learning that my Chinese friend was coming to our home and prepared a table full of delicious dishes for her to taste the flavors of Vietnam. She also expressed her gratitude to my friend for helping me back in 2020 during my difficult time. As a family, we felt extremely grateful and proud of this precious friendship. Even though we only met once in Vietnam, my friend and I were as happy as we were back at school, with countless stories and experiences to share.When I was driving her back to her residence in the evening, we reminisced about many joyful times from our university days. It was amazing how we met in China and then reunited in Vietnam. We were overwhelmed with emotions.The experiences during my undergraduate years in China left me with a sense of reflection and nostalgia. There is a kind of friendship in the world that is worth cherishing: the sincere and pure friendships made among classmates. I\'m grateful for every Chinese friend who appeared in my life — they accompanied me during my hard times, made me believe that this world is beautiful, and made me feel more fulfilled and determined as I walk into new \"tomorrows\".Nguyen Duc Vuong is a 29-year-old Vietnamese student who has lived in China for a total of seven years.

The discovered rock art was photographed on-site, and geographic information was collected along with records of topography, landforms and vegetation distribution.Among the six painted rock art sites discovered and confirmed during this inspection, five are located at altitudes above 4,600 meters, with only one located in a valley at an altitude of 3,700 meters. The rock paintings were all made with red pigment and the designs include big-horned deer, mountain goats, anthropomorphic figures carrying objects and beast paw prints.Professor Zhang Yasha of the China Rock Art Center, upon seeing the on-site pictures, said: \"Rock art is a trace left by humans from the prehistoric hunting period and is one of the earliest conscious creations by humans.

\'appeal\'President Xi Jinping\'s vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind has \"never been more significant than now\" as the world is confronting multiple crises, and the vision can serve as a pillar of true multilateralism and rules-based global governance, officials and scholars said.Ten years after it was first proposed by Xi during a speech in Moscow, Beijing has continued to enrich the content of his flagship vision — from the joint building of the Belt and Road Initiative to the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.Li Shulei, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, told a forum on Wednesday that the vision, rooted in the 5,000-year-long Chinese civilization, has increasingly shown prominent values to the contemporary world.With human society now facing unprecedented challenges and even greater deficits in development, security and governance, the vision \"follows the aspirations of people of various countries and has showcased powerful influence and appeal\", he said.Beijing will continue to follow a path of peaceful development, actively take part in the reform and development of the global governance system, and offer new opportunities to the world with new achievements in its modernization, Li said.The vision has been written into United Nations documents multiple times, and while advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, has won active support from three quarters of countries in the world, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.Stjepan Mesic, who served as Croatian president from 2000 to 2010, said that Xi\'s vision for the world is \"filled with the belief that a better future for humanity can be achieved through a shared future based on equal partnership and dialogue, and by pursuing green and low-carbon development\".Mesic, who has met with Xi and read Xi\'s books, said he firmly believes that the Chinese president\'s domestic and international policies have always been committed to providing good and stable life for people in China and around the world.He noted that Beijing has been working intensively for greater democracy in international relations, and China\'s grand strategy for building a community with a shared future for mankind is \"in sharp contrast to the geopolitical strategies of other global powers\".\"President Xi is the only global leader who has envisioned and proposed a kind of world order that gives advantage to the interests of humanity and global peace, and has upheld the ideal of a world in which different civilizations and social systems are equal,\" he said.Essam Sharaf, a former prime minister of Egypt, said he believes the pillars of the Chinese path to modernization are cooperation, harmony, peace and development, and Beijing has presented these principles to the world through a set of global initiatives — the BRI, the GDI, the GSI and the GCI.\"If we seriously want to move from this very risky world, from a world of domination to a world of understanding, respect and cooperation, we should follow the guidelines of these four initiatives,\" Sharaf said.The building of a community with a shared future for mankind can pave the way for law-based international relations, rules-based global governance and true multilateralism, he added.Grzegorz Kolodko, a professor of economics and former deputy prime minister of Poland, described the BRI as a great initiative, saying that his country is definitely \"very much in favor of looking for a shared future for mankind\".He called on countries involved in the BRI to strengthen the soft aspects of the initiative — intellectual and cultural relations, and bonds between different peoples. \"In times of rising international tensions caused by the ill-advised Second Cold War, the soft aspects of the Belt and Road Initiative can be a breath of fresh air.\"Martin Albrow, a fellow of the British Academy of Social Sciences, said the policy address delivered by the Chinese president at the United Nations Office at Geneva on building a community with a shared future for mankind \"marked another step in the learning journey toward a diverse, open and inclusive world\".\"China has been at the

Qiu has gradually taken over the family enterprise from his father — transforming it from a traditional manufacturer to a creative and cultural leader in the industry.Yet Qiu is only part of the high-quality development in Chenghai, which is known as China\'s toy and gift capital, where six out of every 10 toys in the nation are produced.With China charting a course for high-quality development, a modern socialist country in all respects\", Chenghai has worked over the years to become a leader for this initiative in Guangdong.The toy industry in Chenghai, long plagued by problems of weak independent brands and a lack of leading enterprises in original intellectual property, underwent a tough upgrading and transformation, with some companies finally achieving success after several decades.Backed by public service institutions, cooperation between industry and universities, and protection of intellectual property rights, Chenghai now boasts 42,300 business entities and more than 125,000 employees. The annual output of the toy industry in the district exceeds 50 billion yuan ($7.4 billion).Data from the local bureau of commerce show that Chenghai\'s exports of toys and gifts last year grew by 33 percent year-on-year to 14 billion yuan.Wang Chubin, the district\'s Party chief, said: \"The toy industry in Chenghai is a major sector that serves as a pillar of the local economy.

From the costume she wore to the arrangement of her singing, everything was different from performing traditional operas.\"The spirit of the revolutionary pioneers is conveyed using the soft, gentle tune of Huangmei Opera, integrating contemporary aesthetics and traditional opera performance. Every performance can be both a challenge and a breakthrough for us,\" says Yuan.To overcome the difficulties and enhance the opera\'s presentation, Yuan visited Huangmei Opera composer Shi Bailin for inspiration, so as to better determine how the characters should sing and move.

He highlighted that Chinese consumers are now increasingly conscious of their well-being and have been paying more attention to their lifestyle and dietary choices. As a result, the company has observed a remarkable surge in demand for natural health food products in China.China remains a crucial market for Comvita — its local sales accounted for 46 percent of its global revenue in 2022, with an average annual growth rate of 5.4 percent.\"Given the robust growth trend in the health sector, we hold a highly optimistic outlook for our business in China this year,\" he said.Comvita, he said, is ready to offer more tailor-made health solutions to Chinese consumers and will continue to invest in its regional product development center in Shenzhen, Guangdong province.Besides, it will continue to participate in the CIIE in Shanghai in November.Global market research firm McKinsey & Co estimated that by 2025, China will likely boast 500 million middle-income consumers. By 2031, China will become the second-largest consumption market, trailing only the United States.During the visit of New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins to China in late June, Comvita and Ole, a premium supermarket chain owned by State-owned China Resources (Holdings) Co Ltd, signed an agreement in Beijing to accelerate the localization and commercialization of Comvita\'s Harmony Plan within the Chinese market.Under the Harmony Plan, Comvita, in association with local governments, communities, business partners and nongovernmental organizations, will invest 1 percent of its profit in China to help cut carbon emissions, protect bees\' living environment and improve biodiversity.\"China stands out as the most dynamic and rapidly evolving market, necessitating foreign brands to grasp local market trends and consumer preferences, while demonstrating agility in business planning and operational efficiency,\" Banfield said.Toward that goal, Comvita underwent a transformative phase over the past two years by reinforcing its local team, specifically enhancing its product development capabilities within China. Such efforts led to double-digit growth and a promotional campaign in China in June.In addition to promoting the sales of its core product Manuka honey in China, the company will deploy more resources to enhance its market presence through category expansion in the coming years, Banfield said.In 2022, Comvita established a branch in Hainan Free Trade Port whose preferential free-trade policies help accelerate the pace of introduction of its medical-grade products like olive leaf extract in the country.\"China and New Zealand\'s industrial complementarity will continue to increase their trade in both goods and services from a long-term perspective, as China, a huge consumer and a manufacturer, needs to import many agricultural goods and commodities from New Zealand,\" said Zhao Ying, a researcher at the Beijing-based Institute of Industrial Economics, which is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.China will place higher premiums on attracting foreign investment and foster a more enabling business climate on a sustained basis, said Wang Wentao, minister of commerce while presiding over a roundtable with a dozen foreign pharmaceutical companies on Wednesday.', 'china,comvita,market,chinese,zealand,local,consumers,business,banfield,products', '2023-07-06', '孙迟', 'Buoyed by the increasing spending power of Chinese consumers, Comvita Ltd, a New Zealand-based company specializing in food and healthcare products, has decided to open more brick-and-mortar stores in China, its top executive said.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-06 09:18:34', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/06/WS64a60c00a310bf8a75d6d834.html');

Currently, several Chinese higher education institutions have made their own stipulations regarding the matter. But people are still unable to agree on whether using AI-assisted writing is a novel research method or an act of academic dishonesty.Some experts consider AI writing as just another handy tool brought by the advancement of technology. Yang Zhiping, a professor at Northeast Normal University, summarized his experience using AI writing, saying that conversations with an AI model fed with enough material helped him clarify his research approaches.\"It\'s like exchanging views with an expert who is extremely knowledgeable,\" said Yang. \"The collision of thoughts can be helpful in developing new academic ideas.\"However, some college teachers argue that the convenience of AI-assisted writing can cause students to become dependent on it when conducting academic research, which will lead to the deterioration of the academic atmosphere.On this matter, Fu Weidong, a professor at Central China Normal University, said that any AI-generated thesis should be reviewed in accordance with existing academic standards as well.According to Fu, AI writing is a technology based on collecting and processing existing knowledge, and therefore can\'t avoid repeating the thoughts or even exact texts from existing academic works.\"Once the repetition exceeds the allowed level, it should be considered plagiarism,\" Fu said.Addressing issuesFacing the irreversible development of AI use in academic writing, experts believe that measures should be taken to standardize the application of advanced technology.It is necessary to specify the scope and extent of AI use in writing, rather than just prohibit the tool, according to Xiong Bingqi, director of the 21st Century Education Research Institute in Beijing.Xiong suggested that universities should introduce courses on the use of AI writing tools to inform students of the standards, methods and ethics of AI-aided academic writing.In a bid to detect AI-assisted academic plagiarism, related software that can identify whether an essay is \"written\" by AI writing tools should be developed, he said.The education sector should pay more attention to cultivating students\' problem-solving skills and enhancing their capability of observing, understanding and analyzing nature and society, instead of making academic writing a matter of formality, said Xie Di, an associate professor with the School of Public Administration at Hubei University.Xinhua', 'writing,academic,ai,papers,students,technology,cheng,ai-assisted,professor,college', '2023-07-06', '严茂强', 'It was the night before deadline and all through the house, Cheng Guangyu, a Beijing college junior, was still four research papers away from meeting the academic requirements of the semester.

The second wave will occur from late July to the middle of August, and the last wave will take place around Sept 3, a week before students return to school.The cost of flights to domestic destinations will remain high during the summer because of people\'s surging demand for travel.

Cities well known for their cuisine, including Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, and Changsha in Hunan province, as well as Beijing and Chongqing, are popular domestic choices for Ly.com customers.Xiao Peng, a researcher at travel portal Qunar, said that domestic travel may reach a record high on Friday because of the increasing number of domestic flights and people\'s strong desire to venture out of town.\"It\'s the start of the summer holidays, and we are very pleased that the epidemic over the past three years didn\'t dampen people\'s passion for travel,\" he said.Online travel services provider Tuniu also gave an optimistic forecast for the summer, saying that 61 percent of its users booked long-distance trips to destinations such as Yunnan province and the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region to enjoy their milder climates and beat the summer heat.In addition to these destinations with lower temperatures and breathtaking natural views, cities and attractions with rich cultural atmospheres and historical sites such as Beijing and Xi\'an, Shaanxi province, are big draws for traveling families.\"I was planning to take my 8-year-old daughter to the Palace Museum, but it\'s difficult to get a reservation as the museum limits the reception capacity to 30,000 people a day, because it\'s such a popular destination for families,\" a tourist surnamed Gong said.The 35-year-old from Shanghai is on a four-day summer vacation with his daughter and wife in Beijing.

INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Global warming key reason behind extreme heat in North China - Chinadaily.com.cn', 'The global warming has been the major force behind the extreme hot weather in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region recently, although some other factors also added fuel, according to an expert on atmospheric physics.The majority of this region has suffered many hot days of temperature above 40 degrees Celsius in June and July. Beijing issued a red alert for high temperatures on Thursday, the highest in a color-coded alert system, as temperatures in most parts of the city rose above 40 C.The World Meteorological Organization warned on Tuesday that temperatures are expected to soar further across large parts of the world after the El Nino weather pattern emerged in the tropical Pacific for the first time in seven years.\"The onset of El Nino will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records and triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean,\" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement.Wei Ke, an associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\' Institute of Atmospheric Physics, said the reason for the hot weather in the region was quite complex, but it was mainly due to global warming.El Nino, a warming of water surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, is linked to extreme weather conditions from tropical cyclones to heavy rainfall to severe droughts. The phenomenon occurs on average every two to seven years, and can last nine to 12 months, according to the WMO.Wei said that El Nino tends to cause drought in North China, which could be said to have a \"weak correlation\" with high temperatures, but it only provides a \"small disturbance\" to this round of heatwave in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.The statistics showed that there have been no significant high temperature anomalies in Beijing in the past El Nino years, he said. Therefore, El Nino should be considered as adding fuel to the high temperatures in Beijing and other places, and the root cause is still global warming.He said this summer is not only hot in northern China, but also in the world. In June this year, temperatures in many countries such as Mexico, Pakistan, and Iran exceeded 45 C. On June 21, the highest temperature in Zabol, Iran, reached 50.8 C.He said the repeated occurrence of extreme high temperatures in various regions may be just a prelude to the manifestation of global warming, and in the future only temperatures above 45 C can be considered high.Wei said human has fully entered a new stage of frequent disasters.According to the Human Cost of Disasters 2000-19 report, there were 432 instances of extreme heat events globally between 2000 and 2019 compared with just 130 instances between 1980 and 1999, an increase of a whopping 232 percent. There has been a 134 percent increase in flood-related disasters, 97 percent increase in storms, 46 percent increase in wildfires, and 29 percent increase in droughts or drought-like conditions.Wei has repeatedly mentioned the concept of the \"critical point\" of the climate system.

At the intelligent manufacturing production zone, he learned about how the company has been making breakthroughs in the development of core technologies, and the efforts it has made to ensure power grid safety, power supply and energy transformation. He noted that energy supply and safety directly concern our country\'s development and the people\'s wellbeing, which is one of the country\'s most fundamental interests that allows no negligence. He called for efforts to promote the upgrading of key technologies and core products, and the development of new and smart technologies, so as to strengthen the capacity for ensuring national energy safety and supply.When leaving the company, Xi encouraged the young researchers to aim high but stay grounded, advance step by step with confidence, vigor and the spirit of \"devoting their whole life to accomplishing a single cause\" to make breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies, thus leading a rewarding life, just as a blacksmith in the past would spend years forging a perfect sword.On the morning of July 7, Xi was briefed by the Jiangsu provincial Party committee and government on their work, and recognized their efforts in various respects. He expressed the expectation that Jiangsu province should break new grounds in science and technology innovation, and make new progress in strengthening, consolidating, and extending industrial chains. He expressed the hope that the province will gain new experience for building modern civilization of the Chinese nation, and scale new heights in modernizing its governance.Xi pointed out that the key to Chinese modernization lies in the modernization of science and technology. He urged Jiangsu to be a leader in making new breakthroughs in this regard, and build a national industrial hub for science and technology innovation, so that the high-quality development of the province is largely powered by innovation-driven growth. He called for efforts to reinforce the principal role of enterprises in innovation, encourage the flow of innovation resources to enterprises, and constantly promote the industrial application of scientific and technological achievements. It is important to further reform management system for science and technology, and the systems and mechanisms for talent development, in order to establish a foundational system for all-around innovation. Xi also stressed the need to increase investment in science and technology through diverse channels, strengthen legal protection of intellectual property rights, and unlock the creativity of talent in different fields.Xi stressed the need to adhere to the real economy and build a modern industrial system in order to pursue development in the province. This involves consolidating the leading position of traditional industries, accelerating the development of strategic emerging industry clusters with international competitiveness, promoting the deep integration of digital economy with advanced manufacturing and modern services, and comprehensively upgrading the industrial foundation and industrial chain modernization. He called for efforts to accelerate the development of a modern industrial system with advanced manufacturing as the backbone. To smooth positive interplay between domestic and international economic flows, it is important to actively address bottlenecks and connectivity issues, and continuously innovate new ways and measures to attract foreign investment and open up wider. It is also essential to build a globally attractive and two-way open hub to spur innovation and development in foreign trade, as well as expand international markets.Xi pointed out that building a modern civilization of the Chinese nation is an essential requirement for advancing Chinese modernization and a significant aspect of promoting the socialist cultural-ethical progress. Jiangsu must strengthen the protection, inheritance, and innovative development of fine traditional culture, and actively participate in the construction of the Yangtze River National Cultural Park and the Grand Canal National Cultural Park. He called for great endeavors in the development of modern scientific, technological and educational undertakings to comprehensively improve the scientific and cultural literacy of the people. He also called for work to develop the cultural industry and undertakings, make public cultural services in urban and rural areas more standardized and equitable. Solid efforts should be made to raise cultural-ethical standards in both urban and rural areas. Moral education for citizens should be strengthened, making for a society that values reading, and advancing civility.Xi stressed that Jiangsu must take the lead in ensuring and improving the people\'s wellbeing and modernizing its governance. The province is urged to optimize its social security, its mechanism for boosting employment and its public service system for employment, and do a good job in providing key groups with employment opportunities. Jiangsu is required to carry on and develop \"Fengqiao Experience\" and \"Pujiang Experience\" in the new era, improve its governance system, refine the urban and rural primary-level governance system and the mechanism for advancing village-level governance, and digitalize governance. It is imperative to modernize emergency management system and capacity, further efforts to secure workplace safety, so as to prevent the occurrence of severe and major accidents.Xi noted that as the country is entering a pivotal period for flood control from mid-July to mid-August, rivers, lakes and reservoirs will be under threat of flood disasters, while at the same time, some parts are suffering from severe drought, which greatly increased the risk of forest fires. All localities and relevant departments should prepare for major floods, drought and other natural disasters, put the people and their lives first, fulfill their responsibilities and do their work well, and give top priority to safeguarding people\'s lives and property. It is also imperative to detect hidden dangers of natural disasters through careful patrol and inspection, get well prepared for disaster relief and work hard to minimize losses. Transportation departments should safeguard important infrastructure works, and energy and electricity departments, especially state-owned enterprises directly under the central government, should make every effort to ensure the supply of energy resources and power, so as to keep society and the economy running normally against natural disasters.Xi stressed that since the launch of the theoretical study program, various regions, departments and units have comprehensively implemented key measures in a down-to-earth and practical manner, and achieved good results. Party organizations at all levels should educate and guide Party members and leading officials to implement the requirement of \"putting practice first.\" They should align their study with thinking and practice, and turn what they have learned into conviction and action in a bid to have right direction, and develop motivational power and synergy for their work. Their study should motivate them to make tangible achievements. Firstly, all Party members and officials must establish a view of performance that benefits the people, uphold people-centered philosophy of development, and pursue high-quality development. Xi urged them to refrain from pursuing excessive scale, blindly following foreign examples, taking reckless actions, or playing to the gallery. They should take effective measures for tangible results, and never engage in going for ostentation, playing tricks for personal gains, and data falsification. They should lay a solid foundation for long-term development instead of pursuing short-term gains, and never exhaust resources for immediate interest, only to waste money and manpower. Second, they should have an enterprising spirit to fully perform their duties, boldly take on responsibilities, meet challenges head-on, and have the courage to fight. Work needs to be done to fight against unhealthy tendencies such as being choosy about jobs, lying flat and passing the buck, going through the motions and doing work half-heartedly. Instead, mechanisms should be improved to motivate and protect those who take responsibility and act. Third, it is imperative to create an atmosphere for implementing the decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee to the letter, and take a proactive approach and pool collective strength to put them into practice. Xi stressed the perseverance to hammer away until a task is done, focus on practical issues for implementation and achieve substantial results in this regard.Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and director of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee accompanied Xi on the inspection tour.Li Ganjie, He Lifeng and leading officials of the relevant central Party and state organs were on the inspection tour, and leading officials of the Sixth Central Steering Group for theoretical study program attended the meeting.', 'xi,development,industrial,jiangsu,people,innovation,province,technology,suzhou,cultural', '2023-07-08', '陈柳兵', 'Jiangsu has both the capability and the responsibility to take the lead and serve as an example in advancing Chinese modernization.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-08 20:53:22', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/08/WS64a953bda310bf8a75d6e05f.html');

For many years, people have worked to restore the architecture, but such work was only partial, and there was a need to extend the scope of protection efforts by employing space technology.Guo explained that HIST carried out a project in 2014 to monitor the surrounding environment of the site with remote sensing of an area of 5,000 square kilometers, trying to figure out the influence that the environment exerts on the site to enable better conservation.\"For example, we found some of the architecture had collapsed, but didn\'t know why. Later, through our research, we knew it was related to the flow of underground rivers. Therefore, we continued to monitor the place using new methods and technology, collected data and provided suggestions to the local government,\" says Guo.He also notes that virtual reality can be applied in predicting what influence climate change and natural disasters would have on such sites.\"Technologies like these are opening new doors. Now we need the world to walk through them,\" Qu Xing, deputy director-general of UNESCO, told the opening ceremony via video.The Huangshan Vision, which advocates for international organizations and countries to give full play to digital technology, take concrete action, enhance the protection and management of UNESCO-designated sites and contribute to such sites to meet the UN\'s Sustainable Development Goals, was released at the closing ceremony of the dialogue.Initiated in 2014, the dialogue is a platform for policymakers, site managers and heritage professionals to cooperate and discuss issues related to the conservation of UNESCO-designated sites.wangru1@chinadaily.com.cn ', 'sites,heritage,international,guo,technology,development,sustainable,protection,unesco,site', '2023-07-10', '杨小玉', 'Several years ago, using satellite technology, Chinese researchers, alongside scientists from Tunisia, Italy, and Pakistan, discovered 10 archaeological sites, including walls, military fortifications and agricultural irrigation systems from ancient Rome in Tunisia, at the western end of the ancient Silk Road.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-10 10:31:21', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/10/WS64ab4a1ea310bf8a75d6e219.html');

According to Pegasus, the move aims to boost the market competitiveness of its products.As China\'s high-end clothes sewing market thrives, this R&D center will help the company cater to the country\'s growing demand for high-performance, multifunctional sewing machines, said Okada Yoshihide, general manager of Pegasus (Tianjin) Sewing Machine Co Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary.\"We will increase our efforts in R&D and sales of new products to further expand our business in China,\" Okada added.Official data showed that overseas firms are important drivers and beneficiaries of China\'s innovation-driven growth, with the R&D investment by major foreign-funded industrial enterprises in the country soaring by 91.5 percent from 2012 to 2021. The number of their valid invention patents increased from 68,000 to 241,000.Behind the figures is a persistent endeavor by the country to encourage innovation on all fronts. Official data showed that China\'s spending on R&D totaled 3.09 trillion yuan ($427.2 billion) in 2022, an increase of 10.4 percent over the previous year.The country has recorded double-digit growth in such spending annually since 2016, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Among the latest efforts in this regard, Chinese policymakers decided last month that \"the principal position of enterprises in scitech innovation should be ensured with institutional arrangements\", and opportunities presented by the new sci-tech revolution, such as artificial intelligence, should be seized.\"In the long term, the innovation capacity of China is growing rapidly, and we believe that China will be at the center of the future pharmaceutical revolution,\" said Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of Insilico Medicine, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in New York and Hong Kong.Attracted by China\'s huge market and growing innovation capacity, Insilico Medicine built a drug research and development center in Shanghai in 2019.

They are found in the mountain belts such as the Alps and the Himalayas, where they document the existence of former ocean basins. The discovery and study of ophiolites led scientists to form the plate tectonic theory, which proved that mountain ranges and trenches are sutures formed by the collision of land plates, redressing the prior conception that they are folds caused by the contraction of the Earth.Mountain ranges and trenches are often viewed as natural physical barriers separating different species of flora and fauna and cultures. Exhibit curator Lu Yinghua, a juror of the award and director of Beijing’s Inside-Out Art Museum, argues that “if we see those geological barriers as sutures, we can see that differences are not the natural cause of barriers, but rather the starting point and a synonym for communication and connection”.Lu proposes to look at the relationship between humans and nature through the same lens. She wrote: “Instead of viewing human beings and nature as two separate categories, we should consider them as an inseparable community, where the significance of connection and interrelation far outweighs separation and conflict.”Seeing ophiolites as a beautiful metaphor for suturing, Lu pointed out that those rocks have suggested a way for us to interact with others and the unknown, which, simply put, is to perceive differences and conflicts, not as a tendency for ruptures, but as an active suturing effort.', 'missika,project,artists,cao,choi,exhibit,beijing,water,award', '2023-07-10', '杨小玉', 'Cao Minghao and Chen Jianjun, a Chinese artist duo based in Chengdu, and Adrien Missika, a French artist based in Berlin, have also been engaged in this endeavor.

It has toured several countries and regions along the route, including Türkiye and Uzbekistan, and finally landed in China\'s Xi\'an, the starting point of the Silk Road.The exhibition\'s tour to China can be read as a message of renewal and a fresh beginning, in which art confirms itself as a true facilitator for dialogue, said Pasquale Terracciano, director general for public and cultural diplomacy at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, in a preface to the display.The cultural communication between China and Italy can be traced back to ancient times. In the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC-25 AD), Chinese envoy Zhang Qian began his journey to the West via Central Asia, and opened up a trade route that later became the Silk Road.Originally a setting for commercial exchange, it evolved into a crossroads of different cultures. More than 700 years ago, the Italian merchant and explorer Marco Polo traveled to China on the ancient Silk Road. Chinese culture had spread to the Italian Peninsula through the trade of silk, tea and porcelain, and Roman architecture and art had also spread to China. In recent years, the Xi\'an Art Museum has been working closely with its peers in Italy.In 2018, it held the exhibition \"Beyond the Wall: Xi\'an Contemporary Art Exhibition\" in Florence, Italy, and it was well-received by locals. Both China and Italy boast long histories. Since visual art needs no translation, the exhibition can serve as a carrier for direct dialogue between classical and contemporary art, and between East and West, said Yang Chao, curator of the Xi\'an Art Museum.A total of 31 art pieces from 33 emerging Italian artists and established masters were on display at the exhibition. The artists utilized a variety of creative methods to manifest Italy\'s latest artistic developments, from the 1960s to the present day.

The land, where the desert steppes meet the loess plateau (more commonly known in China as the yellow-earth plateau), dictates for the locals a half-farming, half-herding lifestyle, one that Zhang had reluctantly embraced for many years.The aim of the trip was for Liu, a professor of linguistics and world literature at the City University of New York, to absorb \"the color and the light\", which she had discovered upon her first encounter with Zhang\'s words while sitting in her own home on the East End of New York\'s Long Island, a place drenched in both.But the differences couldn\'t be greater.\"This is where the poet Zhang Lian lived and wrote all these years, where the vast expanse of emptiness, blue sky above, yellow earth below and a dark road cutting right through it, reminds one of a (Mark) Rothko painting,\" Liu wrote of her first impressions of the arid, rain-starved landscape.Of all things, Liu was struck by its expansiveness — previously unknown to her, as she grew up in Chinese cities before leaving to pursue her studies at Columbia University in 1987. \"The sight filled me with pride. Immediately I understood Zhang\'s love for it,\" she says.\"In Village 39/by a large alkaline lake/tufts and tufts of purple/form a patch of twilight,\" wrote Zhang in A Patch of Falling Color, originally titled Twilight, referencing that special time of day, just like all the other poems in the anthology.\"I\'ve always believed that the twilight is infinitely more beautiful than beams of the rising sun. Why? Because it\'s radiant, but at the same time warmer, gentler, calmer and therefore a lot more soothing,\" says Zhang, who, in another poem, sauntered on the village road \"with a bag of twilight and a donkey\".And when he talked about \"gathering water in twilight\" in yet another poem, one gets the feeling that he was gathering twilight in water.', 'zhang,liu,china,gismondi,poet,time,twilight,wrote,2018,poems', '2023-07-11', '杨小玉', 'One early morning in April 2018, Liu Keming, having been \"jostled awake\", stepped outside of her carriage on the night train to be \"greeted by the instant coolness of the steppe air mixed with that sweet, earthy smell of the alluvial plains\".', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 16:38:25', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/11/WS64ac99eaa31035260b8159c6.html');

As soon as the new semester began, Xi immediately held an on-site meeting where he declared \"From my tenure on, I will not be a nominal school leader. I will care about the construction of the school, and solve specific problems in a timely manner.\"To get the college out of its predicament, Xi would hold on-site meetings whenever he could. He took everything, big or small, to heart, from the employment of graduates and the officially budgeted posts of teachers to housing and construction progress of a new classroom building.Xi personally took an active role in all aspects of administration.

With the theme of \"New Era, New Civilization, New Youth, and New Mission\", the conference encouraged young people to share their wisdom and solutions to address global challenges, promote common values, and contribute to the establishment of a community with a shared future for mankind.At the opening ceremony of the conference in Jinan on July 7, Yang Zhen, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, encouraged young people around the world to contribute to cultural exchanges.\"Young people are the most dynamic creators and cultural inheritors,\" Yang said. \"I hope they will see each other with an open mind, respect the diversity of the world\'s civilizations, and actively promote equal dialogue and mutual learning among different countries, ethnic groups and cultures.\"Wang Guan, anchor and commentator at CGTN and a Young Global Leader of the World Economic Forum, held a similar view.Born and raised in Jinan, Wang said his early experience of learning English and later becoming a journalist has taught him that one should always keep an open mind. In the past six months, for example, he interviewed 13 presidents and prime ministers of different countries, and these face-to-face interactions have not only shattered some previously-held impressions he had toward those countries but also allowed him to see that world leaders are also people like the rest of us — people who also get excited by simple topics like family and their favorite sports teams.\"We might not always be the same, but the beauty of this world comes from the fact that we\'re all different,\" said Wang at the opening ceremony. \"Our differences matter, but our common humanity matters more.\"Also born and raised in Shandong, Wang Yaping, vice president of the All-China Youth Federation and astronaut of the People\'s Liberation Army Astronaut Corps, gave a speech at the event and shared her life story.

As someone who started learning Chinese at the age of 11, I remember that in all the China-related materials that I could get my hands on — from textbooks to films — the Chinese New Year has always been mentioned as one of the most important elements. So ever since those early days, spending a Chinese New Year in China has been on my wish list. And it finally became a reality at the beginning of this year.What I was anticipating most about the festival was its warmth as I had learned that it\'s the time of year when family members travel across the country — or even the world — to return to their homes to reunite with their loved ones. Even though I don\'t have family in China, I have the next best thing — my Chinese teacher Huang Li — who invited me to her home for the festival.To me, she is every bit of family. She was my very first Chinese teacher — and also my younger brother\'s — back in 2014 at the Confucius Institute in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. Being so warm and kind, she has always been there for me and has encouraged me to keep learning Chinese over the past almost 10 years.So I was really excited to have the chance to celebrate the Spring Festival with her in her hometown in Huaibei, Anhui province.On my way from Shanghai to Huaibei by high-speed train, I could already feel the festive atmosphere: People working or studying in Shanghai were excitedly on their way home, all taking gifts for their family. There is even a term in Chinese — chunyun, which means \"Spring Festival travel rush\" — that\'s used to describe the 40-day travel period when the world\'s largest annual migration takes place here in China.After arriving on the Spring Festival Eve, we immediately started preparing for the evening\'s festivities. I changed into a red sweater because red is the traditional color of the festival and is believed by Chinese people to be an auspicious color. By the way, here is an interesting fact: If this year is \"your year\" according to the Chinese zodiac, you should definitely wear something red to protect yourself from bad luck.When the evening started, we first ate nianyefan, or Spring Festival Eve dinner, which is the most important and lavish dinner of the entire year.Shortly after the dinner, at 8 o\'clock sharp, the chunwan, or Spring Festival Gala, started airing on TV. The show lasts for five hours with a variety of performances, including singing, dancing, a magic show and comedies. My favorite part was the comedies. Thanks to my longtime Chinese learning and, of course, my teacher Ms Huang, I could fully understand the comedies, even if they say that humor is the hardest thing to understand in cross-cultural exchanges.While watching the gala, Ms Huang started another traditional activity: handing out red envelopes — yes, again, they\'re red. She would prepare the red envelopes with some money inside and, according to Chinese traditions, we needed to say words of good fortune like \"I wish you a healthy and happy year \"in exchange for the envelopes.The envelope I received had 200 yuan in it!Afterward, we went to a park nearby to set off firecrackers, which is also an important part of the Spring Festival celebration because Chinese people traditionally believe that loud noises can scare off bad spirits. I saw lots of people — children and adults — come to the park to watch others set off fireworks.

I think it\'s the cantharellus macrocarpus\' abnormal size and upbringing that has aroused readers\' interest,\" said Zeng Niankai, a professor at the School of Life Sciences of Hainan Normal University who discovered the mushroom.The cantharellus macrocarpus only grows in Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park. With a cap diameter of up to 16 cm, it is the largest individual among the species of cantharellus, more commonly known as chanterelles, found in the province.\"The cantharellus is not rare in the park, but the cantharellus macrocarpus is unusual in its size,\" said Qi Xuming, director of the Education and Publicity Division of the Bawangling branch of the national park.Zeng found the giant mushroom on May 23, 2019.That day, he took his graduate students to the Bawangling area of the national park to conduct investigations and discovered it.\"We didn\'t look for it on purpose, but found it during a routine investigation,\" Zeng said.The cap diameter of an ordinary chanterelle is about 5 to 6 cm, or even smaller, but that of the newly discovered can reach 16 cm. The flesh of the mushroom is white and doesn\'t change color even if injured. The surface of its hymenium is yellow-orange with well-developed gills. Its stipe, however, is lighter in color, either cream or pale yellow.\"From its appearance, it not only grows very big, but also has a bright yellow funnel-shaped cap, as if wearing a defending crown — quite regal, highlighting its unique status,\" Zeng said.He and his students spent half an hour taking pictures and collecting specimens.Subsequently, Zeng\'s research team discovered the same group of fungi in the same place on Aug 31, 2019, July 27, 2021, and May 17, last year.Based on the specimens collected the second time, the research team announced the discovery of this new species.The team collected specimens every time it located the mushrooms, brought them back to its laboratory and carried out in-depth research by combining morphological anatomy and molecular phylogeny.Zeng said through comprehensive studies and comparative analysis of related literature, the cantharellus macrocarpus falls within the genus of the cantharellus, but its morphological characteristics and system position are different from those of the known species of the genus in the world. It was Zeng who named the new species. He added the word macrocarpus, which means \"large-fruited\", in reference to its size.He said that nearly 200 types of chanterelles discovered in the world are edible, and the cantharellus macrocarpus is one of them. But cultivating them would be quite difficult because they have a symbiotic relationship with certain flowering plants in the forest, he explained.Still, Zeng can\'t deny the nutritional value of the mushroom and recognizes its potential. He said that the new chanterelle species contains canthaxanthin, vitamin A, vitamin C and minerals, and the mushrooms are good for the eyes and stomach.So far, eight types of mushrooms have been discovered in Hainan. Five were found by Zeng\'s research team.Zeng said that the discovery of the new species not only shows that the Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park is rich in biodiversity, but also shows the effectiveness of the park in ecological protection.\"Funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, our team will continue to research the mushrooms, which coexist with the tropical rainforest plants and play an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the rainforest,\" he added.', 'zeng,cantharellus,macrocarpus,species,discovered,mushroom,park,national,hainan,mushrooms', '2023-07-12', '张文芳', 'A science popularization article published on May 28 on the cantharellus macrocarpus mushroom, the king of cantharellus in South China\'s Hainan province, has drawn the attention of the Chinese bioscience community, and even the public.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 16:38:24', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/12/WS64adf875a31035260b815e73.html');

It is also seen as a symbol of beauty, grace and resilience.The school hopes that students will plant one of the seeds in their hometowns, to serve as a reminder to never forget where they come from and to stay true to their original aspirations, and plant the other at the university when they arrive, so that it will be alongside them during their personal growth and development, according to a Nankai University official.Elsewhere, \"the Big Dipper letter\", which features seven soybeans arranged in the form of the notable constellation in the admissions letters designed by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, has also impressed many who have received it. The soybean species, called Dongsheng 118, was developed by a research team at the Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in saline fields in Jilin province.Starting in 2017, the team spent nearly seven years overcoming challenges to successfully cultivate the soybean. In October last year, they reached a yield of 2.25 metric tons per hectare, marking a significant step in China\'s efforts to reduce its reliance on soybean imports, according to UCAS.In the admissions letter, Zhou Qi, academician of CAS and president of UCAS, said that he hopes the letter\'s seeds represent a passion for science that will grow inside students\' hearts, and encourage them to make more contributions to the country and the well-being of its people.The letter also includes a book that features applications of 100 scientists to join the Communist Party of China and words of encouragement from 12 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering.The admissions letter from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong province is also eye-catching.It contains a brick of Pu\'er tea from Fengqing county in Yunnan province. Fengqing is the designated assistance county for Sun Yat-sen University, which has pledged to offer the county help in various aspects.Adding tea into an admissions letter is seen as a way to help market agricultural products from Yunnan. The brick weighs 99 grams, signaling 99 years since the tea was discovered. It is also meant to serve as a kind of metaphorical expression to call on students to \"add bricks\" to help develop the country.Beihang University in Beijing has also offered a surprise with its admissions letter.It contains a model of Beijing 1, the first light passenger aircraft in China, which was developed by the university. With joint efforts made by more than 1,000 students and teachers, the aircraft successfully took off in 1958, marking a glorious achievement for Beihang.The admissions letter from the Harbin Institute of Technology in Heilongjiang province contains a red bookmark coated in a special paint used by Tianwen 1, China\'s first mission to Mars.The coating has been applied to the Chinese flag displayed on Tianwen 1\'s Martian orbiter and on the images of the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic mascots — Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon — which are featured on its landing platform.', 'university,letter,china,admissions,province,students,beijing,steel,chinese,soybean', '2023-07-12', '严茂强', 'Around this time of year, colleges start thinking about the designs of their college admissions letters to draw more attention from outstanding senior high school graduates.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-12 16:38:24', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/12/WS64ae0436a31035260b815f05.html');

This cycle then repeats.The work is challenging due to Ereenhot\'s harsh climate, with winter temperatures dropping below minus 30 C, and summer temperatures in excess of 35 C.Despite the conditions, Feng and his co-workers are dedicated to their work, enduring the extreme cold by wearing heavy coats, hats, and boots, and battling fatigue during scorching summers.\"As our work ensures the smooth operation of the China-Europe freight trains, I think all the effort is worth it,\" he said.Feng grew up in a rural part of Ulaanqab, in the autonomous region. After graduating from Baotou Railway Vocational and Technical College, he was assigned to Ereenhot station.He finds great satisfaction in his work and from starting as an apprentice, he has worked his way up to team leader.

The government should return this right to businesses as arbitrary intervention will only bring greater risks.As mechanical equipment manufacturing is a key industry for China-German economic and trade cooperation, Wang urged businesses on both sides to further consolidate the existing cooperation foundation and tap cooperation potential in new fields such as green low-carbon, digital economy and sustainable development.Highlighting that \"decoupling\" is not in the interest of German companies, Haeusgen said the move of \"de-risking \"should be evaluated and decided independently by businesses.He said VDMA\'s member companies support the governments of China and Germany to strengthen communication and dialogue, and create favorable conditions for cooperation between their companies.Similar views were expressed by Klein.\"SAP opposes \'decoupling\' and other related activities. The company will actively participate in building a more resilient global supply chain, call for strengthening international cooperation and formulating unified global data security rules,\" he said.In addition to increasing its investment in research and development in China, the German executive said that SAP will continue to provide better products and services for its business partners in the country.The German Chamber of Commerce in China said more than half of the 288 businesses that participated in a survey in May said they plan to invest more in China over the next two years. The study was published in early June and reflects the business outlook of German companies in China.Jens Hildebrandt, executive director and board member of the German Chamber of Commerce in China, said that geopolitics has a profound effect on companies on the ground, prompting them to drive forward localization and diversification strategies as risk management measures. German companies will sustain investments in the Chinese market as a means of maintaining a competitive edge and harnessing their full potential.German investment in China reached $2.57 billion in 2022, soaring 52.8 percent year-on-year, said China\'s Ministry of Commerce.After it ordered a rethink on how Germany interacts with China last year, the German government will pass its long-promised China strategy on Thursday, Reuters reported.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has repeatedly emphasized \"de-risking\" Germany\'s relationship with China, reducing dependency on the country gradually rather than decoupling from the Chinese market.', 'german,china,companies,commerce,cooperation,businesses,chinese,de-risking,decoupling,wang', '2023-07-13', '孙迟', 'The Chinese path to modernization will provide broader growth opportunities for German companies and the idea of \"de-risking\" should not be politicized or ideologized, said China\'s top commerce official.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-13 09:03:25', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/13/WS64af44aca31035260b81619d.html');

When the case was investigated, the principal loss totaled about 2.85 billion yuan.The Nanjing People\'s Procuratorate charged them with the crime of fundraising fraud in June 2019.In August 2021, the Nanjing Intermediate People\'s Court sentenced Zhang to life imprisonment, deprived him of political rights for life and confiscated all his personal property for the crime of fundraising fraud. Bai was sentenced to 15 years in prison, and his property was also confiscated.Zhang Xiaojin said that the issuance and sale of private funds must be carried out in strict accordance with the law.

Every year during the birthing season, which runs from early April to late June, Li and three other breeding experts — Jia Teng, Song Zhiyang and Zhang Xu — take turns to work 24-hour shifts to monitor the pregnant tigers, which are moved to separate living quarters in a special area about one month before they give birth.\"Every day, the breeders carefully disinfected both the indoor and outdoor living areas,\" Li said. \"The temperature in the living quarters stayed at 17 to 20 C, which was comfortable for the animals.\"The experts paid great attention to the tiger moms, checking their health by monitoring their appetites and daily activities during the 105-to-110-day pregnancy period.In addition, they prepared an ample supply of nutritious food — including milk and eggs, as well as several kinds of vitamin pills — to help maintain the animals\' strength.This year, eight tigers gave birth to cubs, including twins, triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets.\"Usually, Siberian tigers give birth to two to four cubs at a time, but it is rare to see healthy quintuplets\" Li said, noting that on May 10, a tiger gave birth to five cubs in one batch.Most of the young mothers have no experience of nursing cubs, so the four experts took on the task of feeding the young tigers.\"The cubs\' body temperature dropped rapidly as their mothers did not take care of them after giving birth, so they had to be sent to the incubator and observed for 24 to 48 hours.

Many local residents remember how the monkeys posed a threat to farmland in the 1980s, when crop cultivation was expanded to produce more food. The expansion resulted in a shrinking habitat and food shortages for the primates.Li Yongfa, a former resident of Xuehua village, located in the core area of the Mayanghe National Nature Reserve, said the monkeys often stole corn for food. In response, the villagers used traps and bonfires to scare them off.In 1987, the Mayanghe National Nature Reserve was established, and the monkeys were spotted in the area a short time later.The reserve administration quickly carried out work to raise awareness of animal protection and educate local villagers, who were compensated for crop losses. Gradually, the relationship between the villagers and the monkeys improved.\"Nowadays, local people\'s awareness of environmental protection is rising and they are willing to vacate the land for the monkeys, which also gives the residents an improved and larger space for development,\" Li said.In 2018, the administration and the local government started ecological migration and poverty alleviation relocation projects. About 4,600 people who lived within the reserve moved to the Dengta industrial park in Tongren city\'s Bijiang district, plus neighboring communities in other factories and newly built communities in nearby villages.Wu Ankang, director of the administration, said that after the residents left, trees were planted to provide fruits such as peaches, plums and pears for the monkeys to eat.\"We have improved our efforts to publicize, observe and study the monkeys, and also established a five-tier forest and river chief system. Now, 51 rangers are responsible for the protection of forest resources and the prevention of fires and hunting. A special team has been set up to measure population changes among the monkeys and other animals in the region,\" he said. According to reports in Tongren Daily, the measures have resulted in the number of Francois\' langur monkeys rising from 395 in 1987 to 763 at present.Wu is planning an experimental zone: primary and middle school students will learn about the environment via science education and research tours, and by watching the monkeys from 1 or 2 meters away.Meanwhile, villagers\' lives have also improved. In the past, the main industry in Shangba village was flue-cured tobacco.However, a coal shortage caused by poor transportation resources and relatively backward technology meant that villagers had to cut down trees to use as fuel to bake tobacco leaves, which caused serious damage to forest vegetation.\"Now we can get rich without cutting down trees,\" said Mao Xichun, who migrated from Shangba to Xianjin village.In 2003, the nature reserve\'s status was upgraded to that of a national-level facility, and the villagers abandoned the tobacco industry.In response, the reserve administration reclaimed the forest at the price of 4,850 yuan ($670) per 0.66 hectares (equivalent to 1 mu, a traditional measurement) and Mao\'s family received 480,000 yuan for their 7.2 hectares of contracted forest.The administration also offered villagers annual environmental compensation at 16 yuan per 0.66 hectares. By 2020, Shangba\'s residents had received 15 million yuan in compensation. \"The environmental protection compensation mechanism will be further improved to aid economic development and environmental protection,\" Wu said.Shangba\'s villagers have also benefited from other industries. In 2021, their total revenue from growing green tea reached around 200,000 yuan. They have also planted more than 120 hectares of herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, while about 100 households keep bees for honey production.\"Move ourselves, and we have a brighter future; make room for the monkeys, and they have a larger habitat,\" Li said.', 'monkeys,villagers,reserve,forest,administration,improved,protection,yuan,residents,shangba', '2023-07-13', '张文芳', 'Like the fabled monkeys who live on the Huaguo Mountain in the ancient Chinese classic Journey to the West, Francois\' langur monkeys live happily in Guizhou province, thanks to species migration and poverty alleviation relocation projects.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-13 09:41:25', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/13/WS64af4731a31035260b8161bf.html');

The vessel is about 38.1 meters long and 9.9 meters wide at its broadest and has 31 cargo chambers. It is the largest and best-preserved wooden sailing boat retrieved from underwater archaeological operations in China.Thanks to the use of new technologies and equipment developed specially for the retrieval mission, the shipwreck was salvaged and transported to the No 1 dock at the former site of Shanghai Shipyard in Yangpu district last November.Archaeologists have conducted multiple surveys on the sunken vessel since it was discovered in 2015.Judging from sonar imagery as well as the wooden and metal parts retrieved, it was a typical flat-bottomed vessel that was commonly used on the river over the past centuries. In fact, the boat even featured in Shanghai\'s municipal emblem alongside the magnolia blossom, the city flower.To date, over 700 items have been retrieved from the shipwreck. Ninety-five are on show at the exhibition.One of the largest exhibits is a 3.1-meter-long four-armed anchor. One of the largest iron anchors excavated by underwater archaeologists in China, this item was found at the northern side of the shipwreck. After spending more than a century underwater, the anchor is covered in rust and seashells.During the preliminary cleanup operation, archaeologists also found about 8,000 ceramic pieces within the wreck. These pieces of high-quality chinaware, made in Jingdezhen of Jiangxi province, were piled up, with rice husk placed between them to cushion vibrations. Archaeologists also found purple clay wares and a blue-glazed hookah pots from a kiln in Vietnam.An inscription reading \"made in the year of Tongzhi\" was found at the bottom of a series of green-glazed cups. This finding was important in helping archaeologists date the boat to the reign of Emperor Tongzhi (1862-1875) in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).According to Zhao Luo, a researcher with the Shanghai protection and research center for cultural relics, the Yangtze River Estuary No 2 underwater operation was an important milestone in the field of archaeology. It led scientists to develop new diving and geophysical exploration technologies, overcoming challenges, and taking steps to improve the scientific protection and research of recovered artifacts. Some of the new technologies developed are being shown at the exhibition.During the exhibition period, there will be evening events and children will be able to camp and enjoy activities related to underwater archaeology in the grounds of the Shanghai History Museum every weekend.\"We hope visitors can have a different experience at our museum enjoying the activities,\" says Zhou Qunhua, director of the museum.If you goTreasures from Rivers and Oceans: Underwater Archaeology and the Yangtze River Estuary No 29 am-5 pm, Tuesday-Sunday, July 7-Oct 6Shanghai History Museum, 325 Nanjing Road West, Huangpu district, Shanghaizhangkun@chinadaily.com.cn ', 'shanghai,underwater,archaeologists,exhibition,shipwreck,museum,boat,vessel,river,retrieved', '2023-07-14', '杨小玉', 'Objects retrieved from the Yangtze River Estuary No 2 shipwreck are now on public display for the first time.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-14 09:33:39', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/14/WS64b09305a31035260b81658f.html');

Presiding over a symposium with several major platform companies in Beijing on Wednesday, Li urged the latter to maintain firm confidence, keep innovating and improve their international competitiveness.Companies from the e-commerce and consumption segments such as PDD Holdings Inc, JD, Meituan and Xiaohongshu, and those representing industrial internet platforms, like Haier Group\'s industrial internet platform COSMOPlat and CASICloud, were among the 14 platform enterprises that sent delegates to attend the symposium.Zhao Jiazhen, co-CEO of Chinese online discounter PDD Holdings, said the company is beefing up efforts to bolster the transformation and upgrade of traditional industries, help farmers sell agricultural products and increase their incomes, and support China\'s manufacturing enterprises to expand their footprint in overseas markets.It has continued to invest more in research and development, with its R&D budget surging 15 percent year-on-year in 2022, Zhao said, adding the company will pour more capital into supply chain construction and development of cutting-edge technologies.On the Hong Kong stock exchange, shares of platform companies, including short-video publishers Kuaishou and Bilibili, surged more than 7 percent on Thursday, while those of microblogging platform Sina Weibo and e-commerce platform JD surged over 6 percent.Qu Fang, founder of Xiaohongshu, a lifestyle-focused social networking site, called for efforts to give full play to the role of platform enterprises in boosting domestic demand and promoting the recovery of offline consumption, as well as leverage new technologies and platforms to help more merchants and brands seek new revenue growth drivers.Ouyang Rihui, assistant dean of the China Center for Internet Economy Research at the Central University of Finance and Economics, said the platform economy has been instrumental in promoting high-quality economic development and improving the country\'s competitiveness on the global stage.\"Facilitating the development of the platform economy is of great significance to give a strong boost to economic recovery, inject new momentum into consumption growth, provide more flexible job opportunities, and ensure people\'s livelihoods,\" he said.Xu Ran, CEO of Chinese e-commerce giant JD, said the company has invested more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) in basic science and technology R&D since 2017, and is committed to enhancing the resilience and safety of supply chains by leveraging digital technologies.As the symposium focused on innovation, Han Wei, executive director of the Competition Law Research Center at the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that China\'s high-quality economic development cannot ignore or neglect innovation.\"The platform economy is technologically intensive and highly dynamic. Many innovations coming from the platform economy have had a profound impact on the current international competition,\" Han said.Chen Bing, deputy director of the School of Law at Nankai University in Tianjin, said the country\'s regulation over platform companies will focus on guiding them toward better compliance, and promoting their healthy development, which will boost market expectations and confidence.According to a CITIC Securities report, such moves coincided with platform companies\' efforts to address concerns like the rise of monopolies.

It is a way of life that weaves a story of ecological harmony, traditional wisdom, and modern innovation.The Cultural Landscape of Honghe Hani Rice Terraces was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013. The terraces cascade down the slopes of the towering Ailao Mountains to the banks of the Honghe River.Over the past 1,300 years, the Hani people have developed a complex system of channels to bring water from the forested mountaintops to the terraces. This forms a symbiotic agricultural ecosystem of forests, villages, terraces and rivers.Li\'s fields are nestled in the core region of these terraces. However, the rugged slopes of the Ailao Mountains lack large swaths of flat land, making modern agricultural equipment impractical for these small terraces. Consequently, the income derived from the terraces remained limited for many years.Despite these challenges, Li remained steadfast. \"The terraces are my roots,\" he says. \"We can lose anything, but not the fields.\"To protect the terraces while improving income, Li leased his land to Yue Shao, a local entrepreneur. Yue worked to uphold and innovate Hani\'s traditional ecological farming model, combining rice cultivation, fish farming and duck rearing.The innovative step, deeply rooted in tradition, boosted the income from each acre of land. The average disposable income of farmers in the heritage region has increased from 3,928 yuan ($544.8) in 2013 to 12,502 yuan.As the terraces flourished, so did the popularity of products like red rice, paddy fish and duck eggs. Coupled with the allure of Hani\'s ancient songs, traditional farming methods and ethnic festivals, the terraces have attracted tourists from around the globe.Azheke village in Yuanyang county is a Hani tourism hot spot with its native ecology and culture, which is deemed a living museum of Hani dwellings. Traditional Hani houses, recognized by their thatched roofs and umbrella-like wooden structure, known locally as \"mushroom houses\", have been preserved and passed down over the course of 1,000 years.However, traditional Hani villages like Azheke once faced challenges. Many local young people left for jobs in cities, leading to messy and rundown village environments. Homes fell into disrepair, and the continuity of traditional culture was in jeopardy.In response to these challenges, in 2018, a team from Sun Yat-sen University, invited by the local government, developed a plan that included villagers as shareholders in a local tourism development firm. Through dividends, the company encourages villagers to conserve traditional houses, cultivate terraces, and retain their village household registration.Thanks to these efforts, traditional dwellings and villages have retained their original characteristics, charm, and nostalgic appeal.Today, the changes to the traditional Hani villages are evident. \"Now, many villagers know how to use computers, and some can even speak some basic English to communicate with foreign tourists,\" says Liu Yang, village chief of Azheke. ', 'terraces,hani,traditional,local,village,rice,villages,li,income,villagers', '2023-07-14', '杨小玉', 'KUNMING — Amid the rice terraces in Dayutang village in Southwest China\'s Yunnan province, Li Zhengfu continues an agricultural practice that has been handed down among the local Hani people for more than 1,000 years.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-14 09:33:39', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/14/WS64b093c6a31035260b81659e.html');

The satellite is now being built and will carry optical remote-sensing imagers, data processors, atomic oxygen sensors and other mission payloads,\" said Zhang Nan, chief designer of the satellite network at CASIC Space Engineering Development.If the first satellite works well, the company will launch nine more of the same type to the same orbit in 2024 to demonstrate networking technologies and establish a trial-run system, Zhang said.Satellites flying in extra-low orbit face technical challenges, including a complex dynamic environment and higher drag force, but the advantages that come with the low altitude will pay off, she said.\"Because such satellites are closer to Earth, they can produce pictures with higher definition at lower cost, and can transmit them back to Earth in less time. They also weigh less, and their production costs are lower,\" the designer explained.Li Yanbin, deputy general manager of CASIC Space Engineering Development, said that current remote-sensing products in China are far from sufficient to meet the demands from emergency response and rescue and disaster relief operations, which require timely and low-cost data support.\"Our satellite network is what they really need — it will provide rapid, reliable acquisition of high-precision data and images.

Its royalty rate for Wi-Fi 6 consumer devices is $0.5 per unit. For the internet of things devices, the rate for IoT-Centric devices is 1 percent of the net selling price, capped at $0.75, while the rate for IoT-Enhanced devices ranges from $0.3 to $1 per unit.A positive cycle where innovators are protected, rewarded and encouraged is key to sustainable innovation, said Fan Zhiyong, vice-president and head of the intellectual property rights department at Huawei.\"Huawei takes a balanced approach to patent licensing.

With a runtime of 168 minutes — the longest of any Chinese animated movie — it is suitably epic in scale.Paths intertwineSince its release on June 8, the movie has garnered a rating of 8.2 points out of ten on Douban, one of the country\'s largest review aggregators, consolidating its position as one of the highly acclaimed animated blockbusters of the summer season.Despite Li and Du featured in a lot of movies and TV shows in past decades, the movie employs an unconventional perspective to grab viewers\' attention from the start. It commences with the recollections of Gao Shi, also a renowned poet and confidant of Li, who chronicles the vicissitudes in the life of Li, who is probably the country\'s most beloved poet and whose name alone evokes legends.In the movie, Li and Gao\'s paths intertwine when Li mistakenly identifies Gao as one of the thieves who stole his horse, unaware that Gao is leaving his rural hometown to pursue a government position in the capital city of the Tang empire. Their friendship spans decades, interweaving their personal journeys amid the dynasty\'s transition from peak prosperity to turmoil caused by a rebellion led by An Lushan, who was once one of Emperor Xuanzong\'s most trusted generals.Aside from Li and Gao, the movie also features some of the most renowned poets and artists of the era, including Wang Changling, known for his military-themed poems, calligrapher Zhang Xu and palace musician Li Guinian, as well as then royal members who held significant influence within the literati circle, such as Princess Yuzhen.Interweaving the personal fates of these figures, the film vividly reenacts the magnificent scenes of the Tang Dynasty. It showcases the bustling streets of ancient Chang\'an, the vibrant and prosperous city of Yangzhou, as well as the harsh and snowy borderlands in Northwest China.The movie also beautifully captures the nature of the Tang Dynasty. For instance, in the national civil service examination, the highest achievers are granted the privilege to ride magnificent horses and pluck the most exquisite flower from any residence in the capital city.Additionally, during moments of inspiration, poets would visit local taverns where they could revel in the company of foreign dancers, enjoying their captivating dance and melodious singing, while sipping on wine and crafting verses of poetry.', 'film,Li Bai,animation', '2023-07-17', '毕楠', 'Animated movie breathes new life into Tang Dynasty\'s most iconic poets.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 10:04:22', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/17/WS64b478f4a31035260b816b2a.html');

Output of equipment manufacturing recorded a year-on-year growth of 6.5 percent in the January-June period, 2.7 percentage points higher than that of overall industrial output.The high-tech manufacturing sector continued to grow at a good clip, as industrial output in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, as well as electronic components and mechanical equipment manufacturing, jumped 30.9 percent and 46.5 percent year-on-year, respectively, during the period.In addition, output of new energy industrial products, such as lithium-ion batteries, charging piles and photovoltaic cells during the period, increased by 46.4 percent, 53.1 percent and 54.5 percent year-on-year, respectively.Zhou Maohua, an analyst with China Everbright Bank, said the recovery of industrial production accelerated in June, mainly due to the expansion of domestic demand and a series of pro-growth policies that helped drive recovery of the industrial economy.Zhou estimates that the country\'s industrial rebound will likely pick up pace this year, though more efforts are needed to provide support and assistance for manufacturers and bolster their digital and intelligent transformation while stabilizing foreign trade growth so as to further spur domestic demand and consolidate the foundations of economic recovery.Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University\'s International Business School, said China\'s industrial economy is expected to maintain growth momentum in the second half, and investment in high-end manufacturing has also remained in expansionary territory.Pan said that emerging industries, enterprises\' digital transformation and digital infrastructure have become new engines bolstering growth of the industrial economy.More efforts should be made to step up policy support, such as tax reduction, land use and electricity supply for advanced manufacturing enterprises to alleviate their pressure and guide capital to flow into the manufacturing sector, he added.The high-tech manufacturing sector has become an important driver of China\'s economic growth, said Li Dongsheng, founder and chairman of consumer electronics maker TCL Technology Group Corp.Li urged Chinese enterprises to continuously pool more resources into indigenous R&D, achieve breakthroughs in key technologies and enhance self-independent innovation capacities.', 'industrial,manufacturing,percent,growth,china,output,economy,recovery,period,enterprises', '2023-07-18', '杨洋', 'The recovery of China\'s industrial sector is picking up pace amid a steady rebound in domestic demand and a series of favorable government policies encouraging industrial production despite challenges and external uncertainties, officials and experts said.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 10:03:21', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/18/WS64b5de39a31035260b816ec7.html');

Wang had fallen into the sea before him. Lin refused immediate medical attention, insisting that they continue to search for Wang first. As a result, his lower left leg had to be amputated.Wang\'s body was found two days later and it was determined that he had succumbed to injuries sustained from the propeller, which had struck him on his head, stomach and legs.\"At the critical moment, Wang rushed forward without hesitation. His spirit will always inspire us to move forward bravely,\" Lin said.Despite his own life-changing injuries, Lin said he has no regrets about joining the fight against crime and emphasized the importance of cracking down on smuggling chains and channels \"that pose a threat to the country\'s maritime security and the interests of the people\".China Coast Guard praised Wang as one of the thousands of outstanding coast guards who defend China\'s coastal areas and territorial seas with their lives.China Coast Guard have dealt with more than 24,000 cases and investigated smuggling cases valued at 21 billion yuan ($3 billion) since 2018.Law enforcers have also seized 9.88 metric tons of drugs and investigated the theft of more than 12 million metric tons of sea sand after cracking down on cases.Lin was awarded first-class merit for outstanding performance, while Wang was recognized as a martyr and posthumously received first-class merit.

This has not only promoted the sharing and exchange of clean energy resources, but also supported the development and utilization of renewable energy on a regional scale, said Xu Guangbin, director of the international cooperation department of the council.China, the global renewables leader in terms of solar capacity, completed a total of 9.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity exchange with neighboring countries in 2022, representing a 20.7 percent increase compared to the previous year. Among them, the purchased electricity amounted to 6.4 billion kWh, with an 18.5 percent year-on-year increase, while the exported electricity reached 2.7 billion kWh, a year-on-year growth of 26.1 percent, he said.Xu made the remarks during a press conference in Beijing last week to announce the 24th Conference of the Electricity Power Supply Industry, which will take place in Xiamen, Fujian province, in October.The conference is crucial for expanding the power industry\'s worldwide impact and carrying out the Belt and Road Initiative in light of the world\'s acceleration of decarbonization and the transition to green energy, he said.An analyst said the BRI has been playing a significant role in driving the greening trend of Chinese power companies in the global market of late.This trend reflects their commitment to sustainable energy practices, renewable resources, and environmentally conscious investments, said Luo Zuoxian, head of intelligence and research at the Sinopec Economics and Development Research Institute.Chinese power companies, with comprehensive advantages in technology, capital, talent, management, and equipment, are believed to be playing a greater role in injecting strong momentum into local economic and social sustainable development, he said.According to the council, major Chinese power companies invested in and constructed 16 power projects in markets participating in the BRI, accounting for 66.7 percent of their total foreign power investment projects.Actual investment in the projects, which cover 10 countries and regions including Pakistan, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam, reached about $1.95 billion, accounting for 57.7 percent of the total foreign investment by major Chinese power companies last year, it said.Major Chinese power companies signed 102 new overseas engineering contracts in markets involved in the BRI, accounting for 53.1 percent of the total number of new power contract projects. The total contract value of the projects, which cover 23 countries and regions in Asia, Africa, and Europe, was around $22.09 billion, accounting for 67.4 percent of the total new overseas engineering contracts signed in 2022.According to the council, ever since China ceased new overseas coal-fired power projects in 2021, the country\'s power industry made active adjustments, with major domestic power companies shifting their focus to green investments.In 2022, renewable energy became the sector with the highest number of foreign investment projects, accounting for about 58 percent of the total. Among them, there were eight solar power projects, accounting for 33 percent of the total, with an investment amount of $1.33 billion, and six wind power projects, or 25 percent of the total, with an investment of $519 million.In addition to solar and wind power, investment opportunities in energy storage, hydrogen energy, integrated energy, and complementary multiple energy sources have also significantly increased, according to the council.', 'power,energy,percent,companies,projects,electricity,billion,council,chinese,total', '2023-07-18', '杨洋', 'Chinese power companies are increasingly focusing on renewable energy projects such as solar and wind power globally, an industry report showed.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 10:03:22', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/18/WS64b5e18ea31035260b816f27.html');
INSERT INTO `newsinfo` VALUES ('Expert takes pride in nation\'s environmental progress - Chinadaily.com.cn', 'Nation has surpassed West in terms of information disclosure, monitoringRecounting his over 20 years of experience in the environmental protection sector, Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a nongovernmental organization, discussed his great pride in having witnessed the transformation of China\'s role in global environmental governance.He said that rather than mostly borrowing from Western experience, the country has become an environmental solution provider, despite the fact that environmental protection work only began here half a century ago following the first national environmental protection conference, a remark echoed by many other experts.Ma was speaking ahead of an ongoing national conference on environmental protection, the ninth of its kind since 1973.Following years of concern about the environment in China, Ma launched his institute in 2006, hoping to tap into the potential of raising awareness about environmental issues to mobilize greater public participation in environmental law enforcement.This approach was borrowed from the West, he said, noting that it is one of the three stages in environmental governance in developed nations, following government\'s command-and-control approach, and the use of market tools.The IPE has since witnessed China make a \"historic stride\" in developing the mechanism, and in some aspects surpassed Western countries, Ma said.Sharing informationAccording to reports from the Pollution Information Transparency Index, which has been compiled 10 times since 2009 by the IPE and the Natural Resources Defense Council, 24,345 pieces of environmental information were made public in 2008, compared to 324,956 in 2018.Ma stressed 2013 as an important year in the nation\'s environmental protection efforts, as this was when China made hourly disclosures of six pollutants including PM2.5 and ozone, and then introduced a regulation requiring key polluters to release information from automated monitoring equipment about wastewater every two hours and about exhaust on an hourly basis.China is a pioneer of this kind of large-scale, real-time environmental information disclosure by companies, Ma emphasized.He still remembers the reaction of a group of environmental researchers from the United States when he introduced them to the mechanism not long after its launch.\"Some of them sighed emotionally. They said that for a long time, they had come to China to share their experiences, but the mechanism made them feel that it was now necessary for them to learn from China,\" Ma recalled.With the support of information technology, China has created innovative solutions in environmental information disclosure, he said, citing the Blue Map as an example.Launched by the IPE in 2014, the app helps the public file reports about environmental violations, as well as monitor air and water quality and local sources of pollution.In 2016, the app was connected to a State-developed public supervision platform for the treatment of black, odorous bodies of water, allowing tips from whistleblowers to be sent directly to relevant government bodies.Following the increasingly large public participation in environmental governance, China has experienced remarkable improvement of its air and water quality, Ma noted.In 2013, the first year PM2.5 particular matter was monitored in Beijing, for instance, the average concentration was 89.5 micrograms per cubic meter. Last year, the concentration declined to 30 mcg/cubic m.Ma said China\'s experience in promoting environmental information disclosure and public participation in environmental governance is increasingly drawing interest from other countries, especially developing nations.Before the COVID-19 outbreak, he was invited in 2019 on several occasions to share his institute\'s experience of running the Blue Map through training programs for participants from Asia, Africa and Latin America. He also traveled to Vietnam to share his experience at the country\'s invitation.Since the pandemic subsided, he and his team have also received invitations from Thailand, the Philippines and South Africa, he said.Promoting inspectionsMa stressed that the environmental information disclosure mechanism is just one example of China\'s environmental governance wisdom that could help many other countries.Another is the carrying-out of high-profile central environmental inspections, which combines bottom-up and top-down approaches to address thorny environmental problems, he said.The top-down approach utilizes the authority of the central government to the greatest possible extent.\"Internationally, no such mechanism in which thousands of inspectors devote themselves to grassroots areas to uncover environmental violations has ever existed,\" he said.But the bottom-up approach is also used in inspections, as no matter where inspectors go, the first thing they do is publicize their contact information so they can receive complaints, he added.Working under ministerial-level officials, inspection teams report to a central group headed by a vice-premier.Wang Yi, a member of the Environmental Protection and Resources Conservation Committee of the National People\'s Congress, said that China\'s green transition experience can be especially instructive for countries in the Global South, as many problems China has experienced are ones these nations will face.\"China\'s experience in the transition can help developing states minimize problems with their development, or help them get onto a development track that gives consideration to both economic development and environmental conservation,\" he said.Wu Shourong, a professor from the School of Marxism at Beijing Forestry University, said that China\'s efforts to promote an \"ecological civilization\" also offer solutions to problems that developed countries face.Western countries were among the first in the world to become developed. But they have been plagued by low efficiency and a lack of impetus in their efforts to achieve further development and sustain their current prosperity, said Wu, who has devoted herself to researching the ecological civilization concept.Promoted by President Xi Jinping, the concept calls for balanced and sustainable development that features a harmonious coexistence between humankind and nature.Addressing a recent forum in Shanghai, in which China Daily took part, Chen Xueming, a professor at Fudan University\'s schools of philosophy and Marxism, said that China\'s endeavors to develop such a civilization may well offer solutions to achieving development while promoting environmental protection.Chen said that environmental efforts in China have already undergone sweeping, historic and transformative changes, and that the fundamental reason for these changes is the Communist Party of China\'s people-centered philosophy of State governance and the nation\'s system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which ensures the implementation of policies and measures for environmental conservation.\"The process of the Chinese people implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Ecological Civilization is a process of creating miracles in ecological and environmental conservation, and also a process of addressing the dilemma between environmental protection and economic development,\" he stated.', 'environmental,china,ma,protection,public,experience,development,governance,countries,mechanism', '2023-07-18', '严茂强', 'Recounting his over 20 years of experience in the environmental protection sector, Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a nongovernmental organization, discussed his great pride in having witnessed the transformation of China\'s role in global environmental governance.', '中国日报', 'utf-8', '2023-07-18 10:03:23', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202307/18/WS64b5e190a31035260b816f2b.html');
